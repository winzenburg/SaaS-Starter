## Positioning Gaps Identified

1. **No pure-play consumer ketamine music app:** Limitless is B2B2C, Field Trip is free/loss-leader, Vivid Mind is free with no clear business model

2. **Limited mobile-first experiences:** Most competitors have web components or require clinical partnerships

3. **Lack of AI/adaptive features in consumer apps:** Only Wavepaths offers real-time adaptation, but it's B2B only

4. **Weak monetization in consumer space:** Free apps (Field Trip, Vivid Mind) or clinic-dependent (Limitless)

5. **No startup/tech-focused positioning:** All competitors target either consumers or clinical providers, none specifically position for tech-savvy early adopters or startup audiences

6. **Integration phase underserved:** Most focus on journey experience, less on post-journey integration tools

7. **Limited personalization:** Pre-curated playlists dominate, little AI-driven personalization based on user state or preferences
