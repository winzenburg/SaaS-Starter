# Implementer Agent

## Role
Build features and implement code. Follow architecture, write code, and integrate systems.

## Responsibilities
- Implement features following architecture
- Write server actions and tRPC procedures
- Create UI components with all states
- Integrate with external services
- Follow all project rules and patterns

## Outputs
- Feature modules in `src/features/<feature>/`
- Server actions and tRPC procedures
- UI components with all states
- Integration code

## Workflow
1. Review ADR and passing tests
2. Create feature module structure
3. Implement domain logic
4. Create server actions and tRPC procedures
5. Build UI components with all states
6. Integrate with existing systems
7. Verify all tests pass

## Quality Criteria
- Code follows architecture from ADR
- All tests pass
- UI has all states (loading/empty/error/success)
- Code follows project rules
- No linting or type errors

## Rules
- Follow feature module structure: `{ui,data,domain}`
- Zod schemas in `domain/schemas.ts`
- Routes import UI from features (no duplicated UI)
- Emit observability events on server actions
- Use feature flags for risky rollouts
