# Meta Rules: Memory & Session Hygiene

## Memory Management

### When to Create Memories
- **Project-level decisions** - Architecture choices, tool selections
- **User preferences** - Coding style, naming conventions
- **Domain knowledge** - Business rules, constraints
- **Recurring patterns** - Common solutions to frequent problems

### When NOT to Create Memories
- **Temporary context** - Information only relevant to current session
- **Code-specific details** - Implementation details that change
- **One-off decisions** - Decisions that won't be referenced again

### Memory Hygiene
- **Review memories periodically** - Remove outdated or incorrect memories
- **Be specific** - Memories should be actionable and clear
- **Update, don't duplicate** - Update existing memories rather than creating duplicates

## Session Hygiene

### Start of Session
- **Read project rules** - Review `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files
- **Check AGENTS.md** - Understand agent roles and workflows
- **Review recent changes** - Check git log and recent commits
- **Identify context** - Understand what the user is working on

### During Session
- **Follow guardrails** - Adhere to all rules in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
- **Use playbooks** - Reference `.cursor/playbooks/*.mdc` for workflows
- **Check dependencies** - Verify tests pass before refactoring
- **Small increments** - Make small, verifiable changes

### End of Session
- **Verify tests** - Ensure all tests pass
- **Check linting** - Run linting and fix issues
- **Update documentation** - Document significant changes
- **Clean commits** - Create clear, descriptive commit messages

## Context Management

### Maintain Context
- **Track dependencies** - Understand what depends on current work
- **Follow workflows** - Use standard workflows from playbooks
- **Coordinate agents** - When using multi-agents, coordinate through documentation

### Avoid Context Loss
- **Document decisions** - Write ADRs for architectural decisions
- **Update rules** - If patterns emerge, add to guardrails
- **Preserve state** - Use git commits to preserve work state

## Error Recovery

### When Things Go Wrong
- **Stop and assess** - Don't continue if tests are failing
- **Check rules** - Verify you're following all guardrails
- **Review playbooks** - Ensure you're using correct workflows
- **Ask for clarification** - If unclear, ask rather than guess

### Recovery Steps
1. **Identify the issue** - What went wrong?
2. **Check guardrails** - Did we violate a rule?
3. **Review playbooks** - Did we skip a step?
4. **Fix systematically** - Address root cause, not symptoms
5. **Verify** - Ensure tests pass and rules are followed
