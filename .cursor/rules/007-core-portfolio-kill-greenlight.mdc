# Core Rule: Portfolio Kill/Greenlight Criteria

**Goal**: Establish clear kill/greenlight criteria to avoid wasting resources on bad bets.

## Rule

Every product idea must pass kill/greenlight criteria before entering validation or engineering.

## Greenlight Criteria (All Must Be True)

### Portfolio Score
- ✅ Portfolio Score ≥ 20 (High Priority or Portfolio Priority)

### Signal Strength
- ✅ Signal Strength ≥ 4 (Strong or Very Strong signals)

### TAM-for-Niche
- ✅ TAM-for-Niche ≥ 4 (Large or Very Large TAM)

### Moat Potential
- ✅ Moat Potential ≥ 4 (High or Very High moat potential)

### Implementation Cost
- ✅ Implementation Cost ≤ 3 (Very Low, Low, or Moderate cost)

### Long-Term Retention Risk
- ✅ Long-Term Retention Risk ≤ 3 (Very Low, Low, or Moderate risk)

### Monetization Depth
- ✅ Monetization Depth ≥ 4 (Deep or Very Deep monetization)

### Expected Value
- ✅ Expected Value ≥ $10k

### Risk Score
- ✅ Risk Score ≤ 15 (Low Risk or Very Low Risk)

### Capacity
- ✅ Engineering capacity available

## Kill Criteria (Kill if Any Are True)

### Portfolio Score
- ❌ Portfolio Score < 10

### Signal Strength
- ❌ Signal Strength = 1 (No signals)

### TAM-for-Niche
- ❌ TAM-for-Niche = 1 (Very small TAM)

### Moat Potential
- ❌ Moat Potential = 1 (Very low moat potential)

### Implementation Cost
- ❌ Implementation Cost = 1 (Very high cost)

### Long-Term Retention Risk
- ❌ Long-Term Retention Risk = 1 (Very high risk)

### Monetization Depth
- ❌ Monetization Depth = 1 (Very shallow)

### Expected Value
- ❌ Expected Value < $5k

### Risk Score
- ❌ Risk Score > 20 (Very High Risk)

### Opportunity Cost
- ❌ Opportunity Cost > Current Product EV × 2

## Kill Process

1. **Identify kill signal**: [What kill signal was triggered?]
2. **Assess kill decision**: [Is kill decision clear?]
3. **Document learnings**: [What did we learn?]
4. **Reallocate resources**: [Where do resources go next?]
5. **Update portfolio**: [Update portfolio prioritization]

## Kill Timeline

**Kill fast**: If kill signal triggered, kill within 2 weeks.

**Rationale**: Wasting resources on bad bets prevents investing in good bets. Kill fast to free resources for higher-value opportunities.

## Quality Gate

- Kill/greenlight criteria must be checked before validation
- Kill/greenlight criteria must be checked before engineering
- Kill decisions must be made within 2 weeks of kill signal
- Greenlight decisions must be documented

**Critical Rule**: No product enters validation or engineering without passing kill/greenlight criteria. Kill fast to avoid wasting resources on bad bets.
