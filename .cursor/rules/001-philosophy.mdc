# Rule 001: Core Philosophy

> Core philosophy for product discovery & validation

## Core Principles

### 1. Validation-First Development

**No engineering without validated demand.**

All product ideas must pass through systematic discovery and validation before any engineering work begins.

### 2. AI-Assisted Discovery and Validation (Mandatory)

**AI tools are mandatory for discovery and validation, not optional.**

The discovery and validation process leverages a complete AI stack:

- **Manus.im** → Narrative intelligence + raw insights
- **ChatGPT** → Refinement, clustering, structuring
- **Cursor agents** → Structured documents, plans, flows, and code
- **ElevenLabs** → Persona voice, credibility assets
- **Midjourney/Canva** → Conceptual visuals

### 3. Required Discovery Documents

**No feature enters development without complete discovery:**

1. **Niche Intelligence Document** (`/docs/discovery/NICHE-INTEL-<idea-slug>.md`)
   - Niche size, psychographics, subcultures
   - Language patterns, identity signals, status markers
   - Communities and entry points
   - Niche worldview and cultural tensions

2. **Pain Signals Report** (`/docs/discovery/PAIN-SIGNALS-<idea-slug>.md`)
   - Pain clusters (frequency, severity, urgency)
   - Top pain signals (ranked by total score)
   - Moment of Acute Pain (MAAP) analysis
   - Pain cost analysis (time, money, emotional)

3. **JTBD Persona Document** (`/docs/discovery/JTBD-<idea-slug>.md`)
   - Deep persona narrative (identity, beliefs, fears, aspirations)
   - Main job + related jobs + emotional jobs
   - Ongoing vs discrete jobs
   - Triggers, success criteria, barriers

4. **Opportunity & Moat Report** (`/docs/discovery/OPPORTUNITY-<idea-slug>.md`)
   - Winner-take-most dynamics
   - Switching cost potential
   - Data moats (data exhaust, insights, tracking)
   - Workflow embedding opportunities
   - Underserved segments (blue ocean pockets)
   - **Opportunity Score** (must be ≥ 8.0/10)

### 4. Prioritization Criteria

**Prioritize ideas with:**

- **High urgency**: Problems that must be solved now, not later
- **High willingness-to-pay**: Clear budgeted buyers with authority
- **Recurring jobs**: Daily/weekly frequency, not one-time events
- **Data moat potential**: Opportunities to build proprietary data advantages
- **Workflow embedding**: Deep integration into daily operations

### 5. Boring, Inevitable Pain Over Novel Ideas

**Favor boring, inevitable pain over novel "nice-to-have" ideas.**

- **Boring pain**: Problems that exist today and will exist tomorrow
- **Inevitable pain**: Problems that get worse over time, not better
- **Novel ideas**: Avoid "nice-to-have" features that solve problems people don't have yet

## Enforcement

### Pre-Engineering Gates

**Before any engineering work**:

1. ✅ All 4 discovery documents must exist
2. ✅ Opportunity Score must be ≥ 8.0/10
3. ✅ All quality gates must pass
4. ✅ Validation plan must exist (if proceeding to validation)

### Pre-PRD Gates

**Before creating PRD**:

1. ✅ All discovery documents complete
2. ✅ Opportunity Score ≥ 8.0/10
3. ✅ Pain signals validated (top 3 pains scored ≥ 35/50)
4. ✅ Persona clarity validated (deep narrative, clear JTBD)

### Pre-ADR Gates

**Before creating ADR**:

1. ✅ PRD must exist (which requires Opportunity Score ≥ 8.0/10)
2. ✅ Opportunity Score ≥ 8.0/10
3. ✅ Moat strategy defined

## AI Tool Roles

### Manus.im: Narrative Intelligence Engine

**Role**: Source-of-truth narrative and insight generation

**Outputs**:
- Niche narrative and competitive scans
- Pain language dictionary
- Persona narrative and identity language
- Emotional drivers and JTBD extraction
- Competitor landscape and gaps

### ChatGPT: Refinement and Structuring

**Role**: Synthesize, refine, cluster, and structure insights

**Outputs**:
- Clustered pain points
- Synthesized JTBD structure
- Opportunity vectors
- Validated competitor insights

### Cursor Agents: Structured Document Production

**Role**: Produce all structured discovery and validation documents

**Agents**:
- `@Niche-Intelligence-Agent` → Niche Intelligence Document
- `@Pain-Signal-Agent` → Pain Signals Report
- `@JTBD-Agent` → JTBD Persona Document
- `@Opportunity-Moat-Agent` → Opportunity & Moat Report
- `@Demand-Validator` → Validation Plan
- `@Landing-Builder` → Landing Page
- `@Distribution-Operator` → Distribution Map
- `@Pricing-Tester` → Pricing Tests

### ElevenLabs: Persona Voice and Credibility

**Role**: Create persona voice interviews and credibility assets

**Outputs**:
- Persona interview scripts (30-60 seconds, 2 tones)
- Founder intro audio
- Demo narration audio
- Social voice segments

### Midjourney/Canva: Conceptual Visualization

**Role**: Visualize opportunities and future vision

**Outputs**:
- Vision mockup prompts
- Conceptual diagram prompts
- Social ad concept prompts
- Visual style recommendations

## Integration with Other Rules

- **Rule 300 (Discovery Master)**: Master discovery rule
- **Rule 301 (Discovery Overview)**: Discovery pipeline and gates
- **Rule 302 (Discovery Workflow)**: Complete 8-step workflow
- **Rule 041-044 (Discovery Stages)**: Detailed stage requirements
- **Rule 310-340 (AI Tool Integration)**: AI tool usage patterns
- **Rule 040 (Demand Validation)**: Validation requirements
- **Rule 100 (PRD)**: PRD requires complete discovery
- **Rule 110 (ADR)**: ADR requires Opportunity Score ≥ 8.0/10

## Summary

1. **Validation-first development** - No engineering without validated demand
2. **AI-assisted discovery mandatory** - Manus, ChatGPT, Cursor, ElevenLabs, Midjourney/Canva
3. **Required discovery documents** - Niche Intelligence, Pain Signals, JTBD, Opportunity & Moat
4. **Prioritization criteria** - Urgency, willingness-to-pay, recurring jobs, data moats, workflow embedding
5. **Boring pain over novel ideas** - Favor inevitable pain over nice-to-have features
6. **Opportunity Score gate** - ≥ 8.0/10 required to proceed
7. **Quality gates enforced** - All discovery documents must pass quality checks

**This philosophy is non-negotiable. All product ideas must follow this process before engineering begins.**
