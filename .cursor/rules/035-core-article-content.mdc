# Core Article Content Standards

> Articles focus on principles and frameworks, not specific brands or individuals

## Rule

**Articles must focus on general principles and frameworks, avoiding references to specific brands, individuals, or proprietary systems.**

## Core Principle

**Principles over promotion.** Articles serve as educational content that explains concepts and frameworks in general terms, making them accessible and applicable to any reader.

## What to Avoid

### ❌ Brand/Product Names
- Don't reference your own product name or brand (e.g., "SaaS Starter", "Our Hub")
- Don't promote specific tools or platforms as your own
- Don't include brand-specific call-to-action links

### ❌ Individual Attribution
- Don't attribute frameworks to specific individuals by name (e.g., "Greg Isenberg's approach")
- Don't mention specific thought leaders or influencers by name
- Don't use phrases like "[Person]'s methodology" or "[Person]'s framework"

### ❌ Promotional Language
- Don't use "we/our" language that promotes your specific system
- Don't include links to your own product pages or workflows
- Don't reference screenshots or visuals with brand names
- Don't say "our approach" - say "this approach" or "a systematic approach"

## What to Use Instead

### ✅ General Frameworks
- ✅ "desirability-first approach" (not "[Person]'s methodology")
- ✅ "a systematic validation process" (not "our SaaS Starter system")
- ✅ "the durability filter" (not "our durability filter")
- ✅ "a portfolio approach" (not "our portfolio management system")

### ✅ Universal Language
- ✅ Use "you" or "founders" instead of "we"
- ✅ Use "this approach" or "the framework" instead of "our approach"
- ✅ Focus on principles that apply universally

### ✅ Educational Tone
- ✅ Explain concepts without attribution
- ✅ Describe frameworks generically
- ✅ Focus on how things work, not who created them

## Examples

### ❌ Bad: Brand/Person References
```markdown
At SaaS Starter, we've built a system using Greg Isenberg's 
desirability-first methodology. Our product creation engine 
solves these problems. Check out our Hub to see it in action.
```

### ✅ Good: General Principles
```markdown
A systematic approach combines desirability-first validation 
with durability assessment. This product creation framework 
solves these problems through a two-filter pipeline.
```

### ❌ Bad: Individual Attribution
```markdown
Isenberg's approach focuses on validating desirability first.
His framework helps confirm high-heat communities.
```

### ✅ Good: General Concepts
```markdown
A desirability-first approach focuses on validating demand 
before building. This framework helps confirm high-heat 
communities through low-cost tests.
```

### ❌ Bad: Promotional Language
```markdown
Our product creation engine solves these problems. We've 
integrated AI assistants into our workflow. Check out our 
Hub to see the system in action.
```

### ✅ Good: Universal Application
```markdown
A systematic product creation approach solves these problems. 
Integrating AI assistants into workflows with clear handoffs 
and quality gates makes tools work together effectively.
```

## Article Generation Rules

### Before Generating Articles

**Check that**:
1. ✅ No brand/product names mentioned
