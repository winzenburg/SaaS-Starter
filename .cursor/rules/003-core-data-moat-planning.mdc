# Core Rule: Data Moat Planning

**Goal**: Ensure every product has a data moat strategy before building.

## Rule

Every product must have a Data Moat Thesis before proceeding to engineering.

## Required Components

### 1. What Proprietary Data Will We Capture?
- **Data types**: [What specific data will be captured?]
- **Data sources**: [Where does this data come from?]
- **Data uniqueness**: [Why is this data proprietary? Why can't competitors get it?]
- **Data collection mechanism**: [How is data collected?]
- **Data volume**: [How much data will be collected over time?]

### 2. How Does It Get Better as Users Grow?
- **Network effects**: [How does more data from more users make the product better?]
- **Learning effects**: [How does the product learn from usage patterns?]
- **Compounding value**: [How does value increase exponentially with data?]
- **Data accumulation**: [How does data accumulate over time?]

### 3. How Does That Unlock 10× Better Value?
- **UX improvements**: [How does data enable 10× better user experience?]
- **Insights**: [What insights can only your product provide?]
- **Automation**: [What automation is enabled by proprietary data?]
- **Recommendations**: [What recommendations are uniquely valuable?]

### 4. What Feedback Loop Improves Retention?
- **Retention mechanism**: [How does data improve retention?]
- **Feedback loop**: [What's the data → value → retention → more data loop?]
- **Switching costs**: [How does accumulated data create switching costs?]

## Quality Gate

- Data Moat Thesis must be complete before engineering
- All 4 components must be answered
- Implementation plan must be created

**Critical Rule**: In 2025, data moats are the only durable moats for small SaaS. Every niche product should have a Data Moat Thesis. This turns every product into a compounding dataset → defensible advantage.
