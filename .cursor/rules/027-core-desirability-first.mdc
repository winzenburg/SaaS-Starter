# Core Rule: Desirability First

**Goal**: Prevent building features that nobody wants. No build until validated.

## Rule

**No feature or product may enter engineering until all 4 gates are passed:**

1. **Insight & Narrative Strategist completes an Unfair Insight brief**
   - Output: `/docs/product/INSIGHT-<product>.md`
   - Must include: Unfair insight, narrative, target community, early signals, 5 demand-validation tests, distribution wedge

2. **Product Strategist validates desirability via lo-fi tests**
   - Output: `/docs/product/PRD-<product>.md`
   - Must include: Value Story, Why Now, Lo-Fi Validation Plan, 10 High-Velocity Tests, "If users love this...", Early adopter profile, Distribution from Day 1
   - At least 3 demand-validation tests must pass

3. **Portfolio Prioritizer approves based on expected value**
   - Output: `/docs/product/PORTFOLIO-SCORE-<idea>.md`
   - Must include: Desirability signal strength, Niche Durability Score, Moat potential, Expansion revenue depth, JTBD frequency map, Wave/timing analysis, Implementation cost + risk, Expected value (EV) model
   - Verdict must be "Proceed" (not "Kill" or "Pivot")

4. **Moat-MRR Strategist confirms defensibility strategy**
   - Output: `/docs/product/MOAT-MRR-<product>.md`
   - Must include: Moat map (2-3 types), Data Moat Thesis, Retention thesis, Expansion revenue model, Churn risks + mitigation, Motivation loops

## Quality Gate

**Building before validation is forbidden.**

### Engineering Gate Checklist

Before any feature or product enters engineering, verify:

- [ ] Insight & Narrative Strategist has completed Unfair Insight brief
- [ ] Product Strategist has validated desirability via lo-fi tests (3+ tests passed)
- [ ] Portfolio Prioritizer has approved based on expected value (verdict: "Proceed")
- [ ] Moat-MRR Strategist has confirmed defensibility strategy

If any gate is not passed → do not proceed to engineering. Complete missing gates first.

## Workflow

```
Raw Idea
  ↓
1. Insight & Narrative Strategist → Unfair Insight brief
  ↓
2. Product Strategist → Desirability validation (lo-fi tests)
  ↓
3. Portfolio Prioritizer → Expected value approval
  ↓
4. Moat-MRR Strategist → Defensibility strategy confirmation
  ↓
Engineering (if all 4 gates passed)
```

## Rules

- **No exceptions**: Building before validation is forbidden
- **All 4 gates required**: No feature or product may enter engineering until all 4 gates are passed
- **Gate order matters**: Gates must be completed in sequence (cannot skip gates)
- **Validation is mandatory**: Desirability validation is not optional

## Integration

This rule integrates with:
- `.cursor/rules/000-core-idea-criteria.mdc` - Core idea criteria (must pass before Insight Strategist)
- `.cursor/rules/200-playbook-insight-validation.mdc` - Insight validation playbook
- `.cursor/rules/205-playbook-moat-mrr-validation.mdc` - Moat & MRR validation playbook
- `.cursor/rules/210-playbook-new-feature.mdc` - New feature playbook (requires all 4 gates)
