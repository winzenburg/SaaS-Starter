# Core Desirability-First

Goal: Prevent building features that nobody wants. Validate demand before code.

## Rule

**No build until validated.**

## Requirements

Before any engineering work begins:

- [ ] Unfair insight validated (see `.cursor/rules/200-playbook-insight-validation.mdc`)
- [ ] Narrative resonates with target community
- [ ] At least 3 demand-validation tests passed
- [ ] "Would you be upset if this disappeared?" test shows emotional attachment
- [ ] Manual concierge/MVP test shows willingness to pay
- [ ] Community Heat Map identifies high-heat community

## Enforcement

- Engineering Architect must check validation results before creating ADR
- Implementer must not start building without validation proof
- No feature enters `.cursor/rules/210-playbook-new-feature.mdc` without passing validation

## If Not Validated

- Pivot idea, narrative, or community
- Re-run validation tests
- Kill idea if validation fails repeatedly
