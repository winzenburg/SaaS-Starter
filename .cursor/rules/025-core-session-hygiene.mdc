# Core Session Hygiene

Goal: Stop agents from making giant messy diffs.

- Plan before implement
- Search existing code first before creating new patterns
- Keep diffs small: one feature/concern at a time
- Don't change unrelated files
- If unsure → ask for clarification or reference existing feature
- Commit logical units separately
- Review existing patterns before introducing new abstractions
- Prefer incremental changes over large refactors

## Cursor 2.x Notes

- **Glob-scoped rules**: Currently flaky in Cursor 2.0+; prefer explicit rule files
- **Parallel agents**: Use git worktrees; merge intentionally and avoid accepting changes blindly
