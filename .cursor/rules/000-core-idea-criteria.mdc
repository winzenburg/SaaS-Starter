# Core Idea Criteria

**Goal**: Avoid building "feature factories" and ensure only viable product ideas proceed to engineering.

## Rule

A viable product idea must satisfy all 6 criteria:

1. **Strong desirability demonstrated via community heat signals**
   - Proof: waitlists, DMs, preorders, repeat usage, validation tests passed

2. **Identity-level pain or aspiration**
   - The problem is tied to how users see themselves or their role
   - Not just functional pain; emotional/identity connection required

3. **Recurring job with weekly/monthly frequency**
   - Not a one-time problem; users need this repeatedly
   - Weekly or monthly frequency (or frequency boosters if rare)

4. **A budgeted buyer with willingness to pay**
   - Clear economic buyer with budget authority
   - Demonstrated willingness to pay (not just "they might pay")

5. **Clear first monetization wedge**
   - What is the first paid moment?
   - What is the natural expansion revenue?
   - What value metric scales with customer success?

6. **Path to defensibility (data, workflow, switching cost, or community moat)**
   - At least one moat type identified
   - Clear path to building the moat
   - Moat creates switching costs or compounding value

## Quality Gate

**If an idea fails 2+ criteria, pivot or kill before engineering.**

### Decision Matrix

- **0-1 criteria failed**: Proceed to validation
- **2+ criteria failed**: Pivot or kill (do not proceed to engineering)

## Validation

Before pre-build validation (`.cursor/rules/200-playbook-insight-validation.mdc`), verify:

- [ ] Strong desirability (community heat signals present)
- [ ] Identity-level pain or aspiration (not just functional)
- [ ] Recurring job (weekly/monthly frequency or boosters)
- [ ] Budgeted buyer (clear buyer with willingness to pay)
- [ ] First monetization wedge (clear first paid moment)
- [ ] Path to defensibility (at least one moat type identified)

If any 2+ criteria missing → pivot idea or kill it. Do not proceed to validation or engineering.

## Two-Filter Pipeline Mental Model

Think of your pipeline as two stacked filters:

### Heat Filter (Isenberg)
**"Do a tribe of real humans urgently want this?"**

**Proof**: waitlists, DMs, preorders, repeat usage.

### Durability Filter
**"Will this still matter and keep paying 12–36 months from now?"**

**Proof**: recurring job, budgeted buyer, retention loop, moat map.

**Heat gets you in. Durability makes it a real SaaS business.**
