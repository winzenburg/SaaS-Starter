# Core Idea Criteria

Goal: Avoid building "feature factories" and align with Greg's "only build what has heat."

## Two-Filter Pipeline Mental Model

Think of your pipeline as two stacked filters:

### Heat Filter (Isenberg)
**"Do a tribe of real humans urgently want this?"**

**Proof**: waitlists, DMs, preorders, repeat usage.

### Durability Filter
**"Will this still matter and keep paying 12–36 months from now?"**

**Proof**: recurring job, budgeted buyer, retention loop, moat map.

**Heat gets you in. Durability makes it a real SaaS business.**

## Core Criteria

A product must have:

- **Identity-level pain**: The problem is tied to how users see themselves or their role
- **Ongoing, recurring need**: Not a one-time problem; users need this repeatedly
- **Distribution wedge baked in**: Product naturally spreads through communities/networks
- **Match between insight + community**: Unfair insight aligns with high-heat community

If not: pivot or kill.

## Validation

Before pre-build validation (`.cursor/rules/200-playbook-insight-validation.mdc`), verify:

- [ ] Identity-level pain identified (not just functional pain)
- [ ] Ongoing, recurring need confirmed (not one-time)
- [ ] Distribution wedge identified (how it spreads naturally)
- [ ] Insight matches community (unfair insight + high-heat community align)
- [ ] **Durability Filter passed** (see `.cursor/rules/200-playbook-insight-validation.mdc`)

If any criteria missing → pivot idea or kill it. Do not proceed to validation.
