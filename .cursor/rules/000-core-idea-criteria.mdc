# Core Idea Criteria

Goal: Avoid building "feature factories" and align with Greg's "only build what has heat."

A product must have:

- **Identity-level pain**: The problem is tied to how users see themselves or their role
- **Ongoing, recurring need**: Not a one-time problem; users need this repeatedly
- **Distribution wedge baked in**: Product naturally spreads through communities/networks
- **Match between insight + community**: Unfair insight aligns with high-heat community

If not: pivot or kill.

## Validation

Before pre-build validation (`.cursor/rules/000-playbook-pre-build-validation.mdc`), verify:

- [ ] Identity-level pain identified (not just functional pain)
- [ ] Ongoing, recurring need confirmed (not one-time)
- [ ] Distribution wedge identified (how it spreads naturally)
- [ ] Insight matches community (unfair insight + high-heat community align)

If any criteria missing → pivot idea or kill it. Do not proceed to validation.
