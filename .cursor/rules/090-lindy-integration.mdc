- **Deterministic CI/CD steps**: Use GitHub Actions or similar
- **Anything that must be versioned in git**: Code and docs stay in repo

## SYSTEM OF RECORD

### Cursor Remains Canonical For

- **PRDs, ADRs, research, validation plans**: All documentation in `/docs/`
- **Agent outputs and decisions**: All agent-generated content in repo
- **Final copy and code**: Production-ready content in codebase

### Lindy Handles

- **Execution workflows**: Automation of manual tasks
- **Data collection**: Logging results and metrics
- **Communication**: Outreach, follow-ups, notifications
- **Integration**: Connecting multiple services

## STANDARD LINDY AUTOMATIONS REQUIRED PER IDEA

### 1) Waitlist Intake → Segmentation → Nurture

**Purpose**: Automate waitlist management and nurturing

**Workflow**:
1. **Intake**: New waitlist signup triggers automation
2. **Segmentation**: Analyze signup data (source, responses, profile)
3. **Nurture**: Send personalized sequence based on segment
4. **Tracking**: Log engagement and conversion metrics

**Components**:
- Trigger: New waitlist signup (form, landing page, API)
- Actions: Segment user, send welcome email, schedule follow-ups
- Tools: Email service, CRM, analytics
- Logging: Update `/docs/validation/RESULTS-<idea>.md` and Sheet

**Output**: Segmented waitlist with personalized nurture sequences

### 2) DM Outreach Sequencer → Reply Triage → Call Scheduling

**Purpose**: Automate DM outreach and conversation management

**Workflow**:
1. **Sequencer**: Send DM outreach based on schedule
2. **Reply Triage**: Detect replies, analyze sentiment, prioritize
3. **Call Scheduling**: If interested, schedule discovery call
4. **Follow-Up**: Send reminders and follow-ups

**Components**:
- Trigger: Scheduled time or manual trigger
- Actions: Send DM, monitor replies, analyze sentiment, schedule calls
- Tools: Social platform APIs, calendar, email
- Logging: Track outreach metrics, reply rates, conversion

**Output**: Automated outreach with intelligent reply handling

### 3) Validation Metrics Logger → Daily Summary → Slack/Email Report

**Purpose**: Automate validation metrics collection and reporting

**Workflow**:
1. **Logger**: Collect metrics from validation tests
2. **Daily Summary**: Aggregate daily results
3. **Report**: Send summary to Slack/Email
4. **Dashboard**: Update Sheets/Airtable/Notion

**Components**:
- Trigger: Scheduled (daily) or event-based
- Actions: Collect metrics, aggregate data, generate report, send notifications
- Tools: Analytics APIs, Sheets/Airtable/Notion, Slack/Email
- Logging: Update `/docs/validation/RESULTS-<idea>.md`

**Output**: Automated metrics collection and reporting

## AGENT REQUIREMENTS

### Agents That Touch Real-World Execution

**Agents that must output Lindy automation specs**:
- `@Demand-Validator` (validation test execution)
- `@Distribution-Operator` (outreach and community management)
- `@Pricing-Tester` (pricing test execution and tracking)
- `@Landing-Builder` (waitlist and conversion tracking)

### Required Outputs

#### 1. Lindy Automation Spec

**Must Include**:
- **Triggers**: What starts the automation (event, schedule, manual)
- **Actions**: What the automation does (steps and logic)
- **Data Fields**: What data is collected/used (inputs, outputs, variables)
- **Tools Connected**: Which services are integrated (APIs, webhooks, etc.)
- **Error Handling**: What happens on failure (retries, alerts, fallbacks)

**Format**: Document in `/docs/validation/LINDY-<idea>.md`

#### 2. Fallback Manual Workflow

**Must Include**:
- Step-by-step manual process if automation fails
- Tools and resources needed
- Time estimates per step
- Quality criteria for manual execution

**Purpose**: Ensure validation can continue if automation is unavailable

#### 3. Where Logs/Results Are Stored

**Must Specify**:
- Primary location: `/docs/validation/RESULTS-<idea>.md` (exact path)
- Secondary location: Exact sheet/tab name (format: `Sheet Name - Tab Name`)
- Data sync: How data flows between locations
- Access: Who can view/edit logs

**Format**: Document in validation plan or results document

#### 4. Exact Documentation References (REQUIRED)

**Every Lindy spec MUST include exact paths and references** (see Rule 091):

- **Exact doc path for thresholds**: `/docs/validation/VALIDATION-PLAN-<idea>.md` (full path, not placeholder)
- **Exact sheet/tab name for logging**: `Sheet Name - Tab Name` (format: `Validation Metrics - Waitlist Intake`)
- **Exact asset folder for creatives**: `/docs/validation/assets/<idea>/` (full path from repo root)
- **Exact ElevenLabs links**: Full URL or file path (not placeholder)

**Why**: Makes the entire factory predictable and enables automation without manual intervention.

## CREDIT AWARENESS

### Lindy Credit Usage

- **Credits per task/action**: Each automation step consumes credits
- **Batch tasks**: Use sparingly (high credit cost)
- **Summarized steps**: Prefer when possible (lower credit cost)
- **Free/Pro limits**: Monitor usage to stay within plan limits

### Optimization Strategies

- **Batch operations**: Group similar actions to reduce credit usage
- **Conditional logic**: Skip unnecessary steps based on conditions
- **Caching**: Reuse data when possible to avoid redundant API calls
- **Summarization**: Use AI to summarize data instead of processing everything

### Monitoring

- Track credit usage in Lindy dashboard
- Set alerts for high usage
- Review and optimize workflows regularly
- Document credit costs in automation specs

## Integration with Validation Workflows

### With Demand-Validator

**Integration Point**: Validation test execution

**Workflow**:
1. Demand-Validator creates validation plan
2. Lindy automation executes tests (outreach, landing, etc.)
3. Results logged to RESULTS document and Sheet
4. Daily summary sent to team

### With Distribution-Operator

**Integration Point**: Outreach and community management

**Workflow**:
1. Distribution-Operator creates posting calendar and DM scripts
2. Lindy automation executes outreach sequence
3. Replies triaged and routed
4. Metrics logged and reported

### With Pricing-Tester

**Integration Point**: Pricing test execution
