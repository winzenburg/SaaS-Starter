# Rule 042: Pain Signal Analysis

> Stage 2 of Product Discovery: Extract the real painful, expensive, urgent problems the niche feels

## Core Principle

**Every product idea must have a complete pain signal analysis before persona & JTBD analysis.**

### Stage Gate

**No product idea proceeds to Stage 3 (Persona & JTBD) without completing Stage 2 (Pain Signal Analysis).**

## Agent: Pain-Signal-Agent

**Purpose**: Extract and analyze the real painful, expensive, urgent problems the niche feels

## Inputs

### Required Inputs

1. **Manus Pain Language List** (REQUIRED)
   - Direct quotes of pain language from Manus
   - Frustration statements
   - "I wish..." statements
   - Problem descriptions
   - Identity-level pain points

2. **Competitor Complaints** (REQUIRED)
   - Complaints about competitors from Manus
   - What competitors don't solve
   - Unmet needs
   - Pain points competitors don't address

3. **Persona Insights** (REQUIRED)
   - Persona insights from Manus
   - Identity-level motivations
   - Emotional drivers
   - Pain context from persona

## Tasks

### 1. Cluster Pains by Frequency, Urgency, Emotional Intensity

**What to Cluster**:
- **Frequency**: How often does the pain occur? (Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly/Event-driven/Rare)
- **Urgency**: How urgent is solving this pain? (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- **Emotional Intensity**: How emotionally intense is the pain? (Mild/Moderate/Severe/Critical)

**Clustering Process**:
- Group pains by frequency
- Group pains by urgency
- Group pains by emotional intensity
- Identify pain patterns
- Create pain clusters

**Output**: Included in pain signals document

### 2. Score Pains (1–10) on 5 Dimensions

**Scoring Dimensions**:

1. **Urgency** (1-10): How urgent is solving this pain?
   - 1-3: Low urgency (can wait)
   - 4-6: Medium urgency (should solve soon)
   - 7-8: High urgency (must solve soon)
   - 9-10: Critical urgency (must solve now)

2. **Recurrence** (1-10): How often does the pain occur?
   - 1-3: Rare (occasionally)
   - 4-6: Moderate (regularly)
   - 7-8: Frequent (often)
   - 9-10: Constant (always)

3. **Cost** (1-10): What is the total cost (time/money/emotional)?
   - 1-3: Low cost (minimal impact)
   - 4-6: Moderate cost (noticeable impact)
   - 7-8: High cost (significant impact)
   - 9-10: Extreme cost (devastating impact)

4. **Workaround Complexity** (1-10): How difficult is it to work around?
   - 1-3: Easy workaround (simple solution exists)
   - 4-6: Moderate workaround (some effort required)
   - 7-8: Difficult workaround (significant effort required)
   - 9-10: No workaround (no viable solution exists)

5. **Monetization Difficulty** (1-10): How difficult is it to monetize this pain?
   - 1-3: Easy to monetize (clear willingness to pay)
   - 4-6: Moderate monetization (some willingness to pay)
   - 7-8: Difficult monetization (unclear willingness to pay)
   - 9-10: Very difficult monetization (no willingness to pay)

**Total Score**: Sum of all 5 dimensions (out of 50)

**Output**: Included in pain signals document

### 3. Identify the "Moment of Acute Pain" (MAAP)

**What to Identify**:
- **When**: When is pain most intense?
- **Triggers**: What triggers acute pain moments?
- **Context**: What context makes pain unbearable?
- **Behavior**: What do people do during acute pain moments?
- **Seeking Solutions**: When do people actively seek solutions?

**MAAP Characteristics**:
- Pain is at its peak intensity
- Person is actively seeking solutions
- Willingness to pay is highest
- Emotional intensity is maximum
- Urgency is critical

**Output**: Included in pain signals document

### 4. Identify "Expensive Problems" the Niche is Already Paying For

**What to Identify**:
- **Current Spending**: What are niche members already paying for?
- **Expensive Solutions**: What expensive solutions exist?
- **Budget Allocation**: Where is budget already allocated?
- **Willingness to Pay**: What signals willingness to pay?
- **Price Anchors**: What price points are niche members used to?

**Expensive Problem Indicators**:
- Niche members already pay for related solutions
- High price points for current solutions
- Budget is allocated to solve this problem
- Clear willingness to pay signals
- Price anchors exist in the market

**Output**: Included in pain signals document

### 5. Identify Pains with Potential for Workflow Embedding

**What to Identify**:
- **Workflow Integration**: Can pain be solved through workflow integration?
- **Daily Usage**: Is pain part of daily workflow?
- **Workflow Dependencies**: Do workflows depend on solving this pain?
- **Workflow Lock-In**: Can solving this pain create workflow lock-in?
- **Embedding Potential**: How strong is workflow embedding potential? (Low/Medium/High)

**Workflow Embedding Indicators**:
- Pain occurs during daily workflow
- Solving pain requires workflow integration
- Workflows depend on solving this pain
- High potential for workflow lock-in
- Strong embedding potential

**Output**: Included in pain signals document

## Output

**Output**: `/docs/discovery/PAIN-SIGNALS-<idea-slug>.md`

**Required Sections**:
1. Pain Clusters (by frequency, urgency, emotional intensity)
2. Top Pain Signals (ranked by total score)
3. Pain Scores (all 5 dimensions, total out of 50)
4. Moment of Acute Pain (MAAP) Analysis
5. Expensive Problems (What Niche is Already Paying For)
6. Pains with Workflow Embedding Potential
7. Recommendations

## Quality Gates

**All pain signal outputs must pass quality gates**:

- ✅ **Pains clustered** (by frequency, urgency, emotional intensity)
- ✅ **All pains scored** (all 5 dimensions: urgency, recurrence, cost, workaround complexity, monetization difficulty)
- ✅ **Top pain signals identified** (ranked by total score)
- ✅ **MAAP identified** (moment of acute pain clearly defined)
- ✅ **Expensive problems identified** (what niche is already paying for)
- ✅ **Workflow embedding potential identified** (pains with embedding potential)
- ✅ **Recommendations provided** (prioritization, next steps)

## Integration with Other Rules

- **Rule 300 (Discovery Master)**: Discovery master rule
- **Rule 301 (Discovery Overview)**: Discovery overview and gates
- **Rule 302 (Discovery Workflow)**: Complete 8-step workflow
- **Rule 310 (Manus in Discovery)**: Manus output usage
- **Rule 320 (ChatGPT Refinement)**: ChatGPT refinement patterns
- **Rule 041 (Niche Intelligence)**: Previous stage (required input)
- **Rule 043 (Persona & JTBD)**: Next stage (pain signals inform persona)

## Enforcement

### Pre-Persona & JTBD Checks

**Before starting Persona & JTBD Analysis**:
1. ✅ Pain signals document must exist
2. ✅ All 5 tasks must be complete
3. ✅ All quality gates must pass

### Agent Requirements

**@Pain-Signal-Agent must**:
1. Read Manus pain language list, competitor complaints, persona insights
2. Complete all 5 tasks
3. Score all pains on 5 dimensions
4. Produce structured pain signals document
5. Ensure all quality gates pass

## Summary

1. **Inputs**: Manus pain language list (required), competitor complaints (required), persona insights (required)
2. **Tasks**: Cluster pains, score pains (5 dimensions), identify MAAP, identify expensive problems, identify workflow embedding potential
3. **Output**: `/docs/discovery/PAIN-SIGNALS-<idea-slug>.md`
4. **Stage Gate**: Cannot proceed to Stage 3 without completing Stage 2

**Pain Signal Analysis is required before Persona & JTBD. It identifies the most painful, urgent, monetizable problems.**
