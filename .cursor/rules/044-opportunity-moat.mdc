# Rule 044: Opportunity & Moat

> Stage 4 of Product Discovery: Find where your product can earn a defensive moat in the niche

## Core Principle

**Every product idea must have a complete opportunity & moat analysis before validation planning. Opportunity Score must be ≥ 8.0/10 to proceed.**

### Stage Gate

**No product idea proceeds to Validation Phase without completing Stage 4 (Opportunity & Moat) and achieving Opportunity Score ≥ 8.0/10.**

## Agent: Opportunity-Moat-Agent

   - Data moat strength
   - Workflow embedding potential
   - Blue ocean opportunity size

**Total**: 10.0 points maximum

**Threshold**: ≥ 8.0/10 required to proceed

**Output**: Included in opportunity document

4. ✅ All quality gates must pass

### Pre-Engineering Checks

**Before starting Engineering**:
1. ✅ Opportunity Score must be ≥ 8.0/10
2. ✅ Validation must have passed
3. ✅ Opportunity document must exist

### Agent Requirements

**@Opportunity-Moat-Agent must**:

3. Calculate Opportunity Score
4. Produce structured opportunity document
5. Ensure all quality gates pass

## Summary

1. **Inputs**: Competitor gaps from Manus (required), Pain Signals doc (required), JTBD doc (required)
2. **Tasks**: Identify high-leverage opportunities, propose 3-5 moat-ready concepts, provide Midjourney/Canva prompts, produce Opportunity Score

4. **Opportunity Score Gate**: Must be ≥ 8.0/10 to proceed to validation
5. **Stage Gate**: Cannot proceed to Validation Phase without completing Stage 4

**Opportunity & Moat Analysis is required before Validation. Opportunity Score must be ≥ 8.0/10 to proceed.**
