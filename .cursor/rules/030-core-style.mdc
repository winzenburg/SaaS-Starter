# Core Style

Goal: Consistent, AI-legible code.

- TypeScript strict always on
- Prefer explicit naming over cleverness
- Prefer small functions, shallow nesting
- Keep files short; split when >250–300 lines
- ESLint/Prettier are the source of truth
- Co-locate related code (tests, types, utils)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Avoid magic numbers; use named constants
- Prefer composition over inheritance
