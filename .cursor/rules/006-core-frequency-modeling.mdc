# Core Rule: JTBD Frequency Modeling

**Goal**: Ensure every product has a frequency strategy that drives retention.

## Rule

Every product must have a JTBD Frequency Map before proceeding to engineering.

## Required Components

### 1. How Often Does the Job Occur?
- **Daily jobs**: Job occurs daily (highest retention potential)
- **Weekly jobs**: Job occurs weekly (strong retention potential)
- **Monthly jobs**: Job occurs monthly (moderate retention potential)
- **Quarterly jobs**: Job occurs quarterly (low retention potential)
- **Event-driven jobs**: Job occurs when specific events happen (variable retention)
- **Rare jobs**: Job occurs rarely (low retention potential, needs frequency boosters)

### 2. What Triggers the Job?
- **Time-based triggers**: Scheduled time (daily at 9am, weekly on Monday)
- **Event-based triggers**: Specific events (new user signs up, error occurs)
- **Action-based triggers**: User actions (completes task, reaches limit)
- **External triggers**: External factors (market changes, compliance requirements)
- **Internal triggers**: Internal factors (deadline approaching, goal achieved)

### 3. What Increases the Frequency?
- **Success factors**: What makes the job happen more often?
- **Growth factors**: What causes the job to scale?
- **Value factors**: What makes the job more valuable when done frequently?
- **Dependency factors**: What creates dependencies that increase frequency?

### 4. If Job Is Rare: Frequency Boosters (REQUIRED)
If the core job is rare (quarterly, event-driven, or one-time), you need frequency boosters:

- **Alerts**: Product sends alerts/notifications to bring users back
- **Monitoring**: Product monitors conditions and surfaces insights regularly
- **Workflows**: Product automates workflows that require regular attention
- **Repeated Jobs**: Product creates repeated instances of the job
- **Recurring Tasks**: Product creates recurring tasks that need regular completion

**Choose at least one** if job is rare.

## Quality Gate

- JTBD frequency must be clearly defined
- Job triggers must be identified
- Frequency increase factors must be defined
- If job is rare, frequency boosters must be selected (at least one)

**Critical Rule**: If the core job isn't frequent, MRR collapses after the initial honeymoon. Every feature/product must include a "JTBD Frequency Map." If the job is rare, you need frequency boosters (alerts, monitoring, workflows, repeated jobs, recurring tasks) to keep the product alive.
