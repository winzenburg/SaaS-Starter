# Testing Rules

## Test Coverage Requirements

- **Domain logic** - All business logic must have unit tests
- **Server actions** - All server actions must have integration tests
- **tRPC procedures** - All procedures must have tests
- **Critical flows** - E2E tests for user-critical paths (auth, payments, etc.)

## Test Organization

- Unit tests: `src/**/*.test.ts` (co-located with code)
- Integration tests: `src/**/*.test.ts` (test server actions, API routes)
- E2E tests: `e2e/**/*.spec.ts` (Playwright)
- Test utilities: `src/test/`

## Testing Best Practices

- **Tests define correctness** - Write tests that describe expected behavior
- **Test behavior, not implementation** - Focus on what, not how
- **Isolate tests** - Each test should be independent
- **Use fixtures** - Create reusable test data
- **Mock external services** - Don't hit real APIs in tests
- **Clean up** - Reset state between tests

## Test Commands

- `pnpm test` - Run unit/integration tests (Vitest)
- `pnpm test:ui` - Run tests with UI
- `pnpm test:e2e` - Run E2E tests (Playwright)
- `pnpm test:e2e:ui` - Run E2E tests with UI

## Test Requirements

- All tests must pass before merging
- New features must include tests
- Refactors must maintain or improve test coverage
- Tests should be fast and reliable
