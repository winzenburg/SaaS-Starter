# Core Rule: Expansion Revenue Architecture

**Goal**: Ensure every product has expansion revenue levers that grow MRR without acquisition cost.

## Rule

Every product must have at least one expansion revenue lever before proceeding to engineering.

## Required: At Least One Expansion Revenue Lever

Choose at least one (or combine multiple):

1. **Usage-Based Pricing**: Revenue grows with usage volume
2. **Additional Seats**: Revenue grows with team size
3. **Add-Ons**: Revenue grows with optional add-on products/services
4. **Premium Automations**: Revenue grows with advanced automation features
5. **AI Enhanced Insights**: Revenue grows with AI-powered insights and recommendations
6. **Compliance/Integrations**: Revenue grows with compliance features and integrations
7. **Advanced Analytics**: Revenue grows with advanced analytics and reporting
8. **Custom Workflows**: Revenue grows with custom workflow capabilities

## Required Components

### Expansion Path
- **Initial revenue**: [What's the starting MRR?]
- **Expansion path**: [How does revenue grow?]
- **Target expansion**: [What's the target MRR per customer?]
- **Expansion timeline**: [How long to reach target expansion?]

### Expansion Triggers
- **What triggers expansion?**: [What actions/needs trigger expansion?]
- **When does expansion happen?**: [When does expansion occur naturally?]
- **What prevents expansion?**: [What barriers exist?]

### Expansion Metrics
- **Expansion rate**: [What % of customers expand?]
- **Average expansion**: [What's the average expansion multiple?]
- **Time to expansion**: [How long until first expansion?]

## Quality Gate

- At least one expansion revenue lever must be selected
- Expansion path must be clear (how to get from initial to 10x)
- Expansion triggers must be natural (aligned with customer success)
- Expansion metrics must be measurable

**Critical Rule**: MRR is fragile unless pricing grows with value. Every product must include at least one expansion revenue lever. This is how you turn a $29/mo tool into a $290/mo business without acquisition cost.
