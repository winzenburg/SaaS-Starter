# Core Rule: Compounding Niche Score (NCS)

**Goal**: Identify compounding niches that create durable MRR, not decaying niches that fade.

## Rule

Every product idea must be scored on the Niche Compounding Score (NCS) before proceeding to validation.

## Scoring Criteria (Score 1-5 for each)

### 1. Market Velocity
- **5**: Market growing fast (20%+ YoY growth)
- **4**: Market growing (10-20% YoY growth)
- **3**: Market stable (0-10% YoY growth)
- **2**: Market declining (-10% to 0% YoY growth)
- **1**: Market shrinking fast (< -10% YoY growth)

### 2. Forced Adoption
- **5**: Regulation/compliance mandates adoption (required by law/regulation)
- **4**: Industry standards require adoption (required by industry)
- **3**: Best practices recommend adoption (recommended by industry)
- **2**: Optional but beneficial (optional, but helpful)
- **1**: Purely optional (completely optional)

### 3. Increasing Complexity
- **5**: Complexity growing fast (problems getting harder, more complex)
- **4**: Complexity growing (problems getting harder)
- **3**: Complexity stable (problems staying same)
- **2**: Complexity decreasing (problems getting easier)
- **1**: Complexity shrinking fast (problems getting much easier)

### 4. Community Growth
- **5**: Community growing fast (20%+ YoY growth)
- **4**: Community growing (10-20% YoY growth)
- **3**: Community stable (0-10% YoY growth)
- **2**: Community declining (-10% to 0% YoY growth)
- **1**: Community shrinking fast (< -10% YoY growth)

### 5. Willingness-to-Pay Trajectory
- **5**: Willingness-to-pay increasing fast (budgets growing, value increasing)
- **4**: Willingness-to-pay increasing (budgets growing, value stable)
- **3**: Willingness-to-pay stable (budgets stable, value stable)
- **2**: Willingness-to-pay decreasing (budgets shrinking, value decreasing)
- **1**: Willingness-to-pay shrinking fast (budgets shrinking fast, value decreasing)

## Assessment

**Total Score (out of 25)**:
- **Compounding Niche (20-25)**: Build for long-term compounding
- **Stable Niche (15-19)**: Build for stable MRR
- **Decaying Niche (10-14)**: Build for short-term, expect decline
- **Declining Niche (5-9)**: Avoid or pivot

## Quality Gate

- NCS must be scored before validation
- Score must be ≥ 15 (Stable Niche or Compounding Niche) to proceed
- If score < 15, consider pivot or kill

**Critical Rule**: Only build for Compounding Niche (20-25) or Stable Niche (15-19). Avoid Decaying Niche (10-14) and Declining Niche (5-9).
