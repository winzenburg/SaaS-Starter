# Core Architecture

- Prefer simple, maintainable solutions over clever abstractions
- Make small, verifiable changes
- Create ADR in `docs/adr/` when architecture changes are needed
- All features in `src/features/<feature>/` with three layers: `domain/`, `data/`, `ui/`
- Features export public API via `index.ts`
- No cross-feature imports except through each feature's `index.ts`
- Shared utilities in `src/lib/`
- TypeScript strict mode always ON
- Never use `any` (explicit or implicit)
- Use Zod schemas for all input validation
- Create type guards for parsing unknown data
- Use `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` for safer array/object access
