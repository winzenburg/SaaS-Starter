# Drizzle + PostgreSQL

- Canonical schema at `/drizzle/schema.ts`
- Migrations in `/drizzle/migrations`
- All tenant-scoped tables include orgId and are always filtered
- Use Drizzle's type inference (`$inferSelect`, `$inferInsert`)
- Export types alongside schemas
- Use Drizzle query builder (no raw SQL unless necessary)
- Use transactions for multi-step operations
- Always handle database errors
- Generate migrations with `pnpm db:generate`
- Review migrations before applying
- Use `pnpm db:push` for development
- Use `pnpm db:migrate` for production
- Keep queries simple and readable
- Use relations for joins (not manual joins)
- Index frequently queried columns
