# Drizzle/Postgres Conventions

Goal: Prevent path/layout disagreements between agents.

- Canonical schema path: `/drizzle/schema.ts`
- Migrations in `/drizzle/migrations`
- Drizzle client in `src/lib/db.ts`
- Tenant scoping rule: any org table includes `orgId` and is always filtered by `orgId` in queries
- Use `pg` driver (Postgres)
- All queries use parameterized statements (Drizzle handles this)
- Transactions for multi-step operations
- Index foreign keys and frequently queried columns
