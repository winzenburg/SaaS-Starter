# Core Rule: Frequency Modeling

**Goal**: Ensure retention through job frequency. Retention requires job frequency.

## Rule

**Every feature must include frequency modeling before engineering.**

## Required Components

### 1. JTBD Frequency Map
- **Daily jobs**: Job occurs daily (highest retention potential)
- **Weekly jobs**: Job occurs weekly (strong retention potential)
- **Monthly jobs**: Job occurs monthly (moderate retention potential)
- **Quarterly jobs**: Job occurs quarterly (low retention potential)
- **Event-driven jobs**: Job occurs when specific events happen (variable retention)
- **Rare jobs**: Job occurs rarely (low retention potential, needs frequency boosters)

### 2. Value Driver for Each Timeframe
- **Daily value driver**: [What value is delivered daily?]
- **Weekly value driver**: [What value is delivered weekly?]
- **Monthly value driver**: [What value is delivered monthly?]
- **Quarterly value driver**: [What value is delivered quarterly?]
- **Event-driven value driver**: [What value is delivered when events occur?]

### 3. Mechanisms to Increase Frequency
- **Success factors**: [What makes the job happen more often?]
- **Growth factors**: [What causes the job to scale?]
- **Value factors**: [What makes the job more valuable when done frequently?]
- **Dependency factors**: [What creates dependencies that increase frequency?]

### 4. Notification or Workflow Triggers
- **Notification triggers**: [What notifications bring users back?]
- **Workflow triggers**: [What workflows bring users back?]
- **Trigger frequency**: [How often do triggers fire?]
- **Trigger effectiveness**: [How effective are triggers?]

## Low Frequency Requirements

**If job frequency is low (quarterly, event-driven, or rare), PM must design:**

### 1. Critical Alerts
- **Alert types**: [What alerts are critical?]
- **Alert triggers**: [When do alerts fire?]
- **Alert frequency**: [How often are alerts sent?]
- **Alert value**: [What value do alerts provide?]

### 2. Batching Workflows
- **Batching mechanism**: [How are jobs batched?]
- **Batching frequency**: [How often does batching occur?]
- **Batching value**: [What value does batching provide?]
- **Batching triggers**: [What triggers batching?]

### 3. Periodic Review Cycles
- **Review cycle frequency**: [How often do review cycles occur?]
- **Review cycle value**: [What value do review cycles provide?]
- **Review cycle triggers**: [What triggers review cycles?]
- **Review cycle content**: [What is reviewed in each cycle?]

## Quality Gate

**Frequency modeling must be complete before engineering.**

### Frequency Modeling Checklist

Before any feature enters engineering, verify:

- [ ] JTBD frequency map is complete (frequency identified)
- [ ] Value driver for each timeframe is defined
- [ ] Mechanisms to increase frequency are designed
- [ ] Notification or workflow triggers are defined
- [ ] If job frequency is low, critical alerts, batching workflows, and periodic review cycles are designed

If frequency modeling is incomplete → do not proceed to engineering. Complete frequency modeling first.

## Rules

- **Frequency modeling is mandatory**: Every feature must include frequency modeling
- **Low frequency requires boosters**: If job frequency is low, PM must design critical alerts, batching workflows, and periodic review cycles
- **Value drivers required**: Value driver must be defined for each timeframe
- **Triggers required**: Notification or workflow triggers must be defined

## Integration

This rule integrates with:
- `.cursor/rules/006-core-frequency-modeling.mdc` - Detailed frequency modeling requirements
- `.cursor/rules/027-core-desirability-first.mdc` - Desirability first (frequency modeling is part of validation)
- `.cursor/rules/205-playbook-moat-mrr-validation.mdc` - Moat & MRR validation (includes frequency modeling)
- `docs/agents/moat-mrr-strategist.md` - Moat & MRR Strategist (includes frequency modeling)
- `docs/agents/product-strategist.md` - Product Strategist (includes frequency modeling)

## Mental Model

**Retention requires job frequency.**

If the core job isn't frequent, MRR collapses after the initial honeymoon. Every feature/product must include a "JTBD Frequency Map." If the job is rare, you need frequency boosters (critical alerts, batching workflows, periodic review cycles) to keep the product alive.
