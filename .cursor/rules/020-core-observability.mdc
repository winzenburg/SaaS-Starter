# Core Observability

Goal: Make every template app operable in production.

- Every server action emits an event (success/failure) using a shared helper
- Include trace/request IDs in logs/errors
- Errors are user-safe with internal detail captured separately
- No PII in telemetry
- Critical flows get dashboard-ready events (auth, billing, core CRUD)
- Vercel Observability is a default fit here
- Structured logging (JSON format)
- Use correlation IDs for request tracing
- Log levels: error, warn, info, debug
- Monitor key metrics: latency, error rates, throughput
