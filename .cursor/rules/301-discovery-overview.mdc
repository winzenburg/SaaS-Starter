# Rule 301: Discovery Overview

> Establish a structured discovery pipeline using Manus, ChatGPT, ElevenLabs, Midjourney, and Cursor agents

## Core Principle

**No engineering work begins until the Opportunity Score is ≥ 8.0/10. All discovery outputs must be complete and validated before proceeding to validation planning or engineering.**

## Purpose

Establish a structured discovery pipeline that systematically analyzes niche, pain signals, personas, and opportunities using AI-enhanced tools before any engineering work begins.

## Mandates

### 1. Opportunity Score Gate

**CRITICAL**: No engineering work begins until Opportunity Score is ≥ 8.0/10.

**Opportunity Score Calculation**:
- Based on comprehensive analysis of:
  - Niche viability and size
  - Pain signal intensity and monetization potential
  - Persona clarity and JTBD frequency
  - Moat potential and defensibility
- Score must be calculated and documented in Opportunity & Moat Report
- Score < 8.0/10 requires pivot or kill decision

**Enforcement**:
- Engineering agents must check Opportunity Score before starting work
- PRD cannot be created without Opportunity Score ≥ 8.0/10
- ADR cannot be created without Opportunity Score ≥ 8.0/10

### 2. Required Discovery Outputs

**All discovery outputs must be complete before proceeding**:

1. **Niche Intelligence** (`/docs/discovery/NICHE-INTEL-<idea-slug>.md`)
   - Niche size, psychographics, subcultures
   - Language patterns, identity signals, status markers
   - Communities (Reddit, Slack, Discord, Facebook groups, LinkedIn clusters)
   - Entry points (how founders earn trust)
   - Niche worldview and cultural tensions

2. **Pain Signals** (`/docs/discovery/PAIN-SIGNALS-<idea-slug>.md`)
   - Pain clusters (frequency, severity, urgency)
   - Top pain signals (ranked by total score)
   - Moment of Acute Pain (MAAP) analysis
   - Pain cost analysis (time, money, emotional)
   - Pain scores (all 5 dimensions, total out of 50)

3. **JTBD Analysis** (`/docs/discovery/JTBD-<idea-slug>.md`)
   - Deep persona narrative (identity, beliefs, fears, aspirations)
   - Main job + related jobs + emotional jobs
   - Ongoing vs discrete jobs
   - Triggers, success criteria, barriers
   - ElevenLabs interview script (optional)

4. **Opportunity & Moat Report** (`/docs/discovery/OPPORTUNITY-<idea-slug>.md`)
   - Winner-take-most dynamics
   - Switching cost potential
   - Data moats (data exhaust, insights, tracking)
   - Workflow embedding opportunities
   - Underserved segments (blue ocean pockets)
   - Midjourney/Canva prompts for "future vision" mockups
   - **Opportunity Score** (must be ≥ 8.0/10)

## Discovery Pipeline

**See Rule 302 (Discovery Workflow) for complete 8-step process.**

Quick reference:
1. Manus → Niche Narrative + Pain Language + JTBD + Competitors
2. ChatGPT → Refinement Packet
3. @Niche-Intelligence-Agent → Niche Map
4. @Pain-Signal-Agent → Pain Prioritization
5. @JTBD-Agent → Persona + Jobs Map + Voice Script
6. @Opportunity-Moat-Agent → Moat Strategy + Vision Prompts
7. Score the Idea (0-10)
8. If Score ≥ 8 → Move to Demand-Validation Agents

## Opportunity Score Calculation

**Opportunity Score** is calculated based on:

1. **Niche Viability** (0-2.5 points)
   - Niche size and growth potential
   - Entry points and trust signals
   - Community engagement

2. **Pain Intensity** (0-2.5 points)
   - Top pain signal scores (average of top 3)
   - MAAP intensity
   - Monetization potential

3. **Persona Clarity** (0-1.5 points)
   - Persona narrative completeness
   - JTBD frequency and clarity
   - Emotional driver strength

4. **Moat Potential** (0-3.5 points)
   - Winner-take-most dynamics
   - Switching cost potential
   - Data moat strength
   - Workflow embedding potential
   - Blue ocean opportunity size

**Total**: 10.0 points maximum

**Threshold**: ≥ 8.0/10 required to proceed

## Quality Gates

**All discovery outputs must pass quality gates**:

- ✅ **Niche Intelligence complete** (all sections documented)
- ✅ **Pain Signals complete** (all pains scored and prioritized)
- ✅ **JTBD Analysis complete** (persona narrative, all jobs mapped)
- ✅ **Opportunity & Moat Report complete** (all moat types analyzed)
- ✅ **Opportunity Score calculated** (≥ 8.0/10 to proceed)

## Enforcement

### Pre-Engineering Checks

**Before any engineering work**:

2. Verify Opportunity Score is documented
3. Verify Opportunity Score ≥ 8.0/10
4. If score < 8.0/10, require pivot or kill decision

### Pre-PRD Checks

**Before creating PRD**:
1. All discovery outputs must exist
2. Opportunity Score must be ≥ 8.0/10
3. All quality gates must pass

### Pre-ADR Checks

**Before creating ADR**:
1. PRD must exist (which requires Opportunity Score ≥ 8.0/10)
2. Opportunity Score must be ≥ 8.0/10

2. **All discovery outputs required**: Niche Intelligence, Pain Signals, JTBD Analysis, Opportunity & Moat Report
3. **All discovery outputs go to `/docs/discovery/` with consistent `<idea-slug>` naming** (see Rule 003)
4. **Manus is source-of-truth narrative engine**
5. **ChatGPT refines, clusters, analyzes insights**
