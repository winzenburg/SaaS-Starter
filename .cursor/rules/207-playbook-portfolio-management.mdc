# Playbook: Portfolio Management (Portfolio Theory)

## Goal
Systematized product creation with multiple bets and continuous MRR compounding. Avoid "falling in love with every idea" by managing a portfolio of product bets with clear prioritization, expected value modeling, and kill-fast diagnostics.

## Mental Model: Portfolio Theory

**Isenberg focuses on one product at a time. But your goal is:**
- Systematized product creation
- Multiple bets
- Continuous MRR compounding

**This requires:**
- Prioritization framework
- Expected value modeling
- Risk scoring
- Shared infrastructure to lower marginal cost of new products
- "Kill fast" diagnostics

## Rule
**No product enters validation without portfolio scoring. No product graduates to engineering without portfolio prioritization.**

## Prerequisites
- Multiple product/feature ideas
- Willingness to manage a portfolio (not just one product)
- Shared infrastructure strategy
- Portfolio management discipline

## Portfolio Structure

### Portfolio Tiers

1. **Validation Tier** (Ideas in validation)
   - Products in insight validation phase
   - Products in demand validation phase
   - Products in moat/MRR validation phase
   - **Target**: 3-5 products simultaneously

2. **Engineering Tier** (Products in build)
   - Products that passed validation and are being built
   - Products in active development
   - **Target**: 1-2 products simultaneously (unless team can handle more)

3. **Growth Tier** (Products in market)
   - Products launched and growing
   - Products with established MRR
   - **Target**: 2-4 products (depends on team capacity)

4. **Maintenance Tier** (Products in maintenance)
   - Products with stable MRR
   - Products requiring minimal active development
   - **Target**: Unlimited (as long as profitable)

## Required: Prioritization Framework

**CRITICAL**: Every product idea must be scored and prioritized before entering validation.

### Scoring Criteria (Score 1-5 for each)

#### 1. Expected Value (EV)
- **5**: Very high EV (high probability × high impact)
- **4**: High EV (moderate-high probability × high impact, or high probability × moderate-high impact)
- **3**: Moderate EV (moderate probability × moderate impact)
- **2**: Low EV (low probability × moderate impact, or moderate probability × low impact)
- **1**: Very low EV (low probability × low impact)

**Calculation**: EV = Probability of Success × Impact (MRR potential)

**Examples**:
- **High EV**: 70% probability × $50k MRR potential = $35k EV
- **Moderate EV**: 50% probability × $20k MRR potential = $10k EV
- **Low EV**: 30% probability × $10k MRR potential = $3k EV

#### 2. Risk Score
- **5**: Very low risk (validated demand, clear moat, strong team fit)
- **4**: Low risk (some validation, clear path, good team fit)
- **3**: Moderate risk (unvalidated, unclear path, team fit uncertain)
- **2**: High risk (unvalidated, unclear path, poor team fit)
- **1**: Very high risk (unvalidated, no clear path, poor team fit)

**Risk Factors**:
- Demand validation status
- Moat clarity
- Team expertise/fit
- Market timing
- Competitive landscape
- Technical feasibility

#### 3. Resource Requirements
- **5**: Very low resources (minimal time, existing infrastructure, simple build)
- **4**: Low resources (moderate time, some infrastructure, straightforward build)
- **3**: Moderate resources (significant time, new infrastructure, complex build)
- **2**: High resources (high time, new infrastructure, very complex build)
- **1**: Very high resources (extreme time, new infrastructure, extremely complex build)

**Resource Factors**:
- Validation time required
- Engineering time required
- Infrastructure needs
- Team capacity
- Opportunity cost

#### 4. Strategic Fit
- **5**: Perfect strategic fit (aligns with vision, leverages strengths, compounds advantage)
- **4**: Strong strategic fit (aligns with vision, leverages strengths)
- **3**: Moderate strategic fit (some alignment, some leverage)
- **2**: Weak strategic fit (limited alignment, limited leverage)
- **1**: Poor strategic fit (misaligned, doesn't leverage strengths)

**Strategic Factors**:
- Alignment with company vision
- Leverages existing strengths/assets
- Compounds existing advantages
- Creates synergies with other products
- Builds on shared infrastructure

#### 5. Time to Value
- **5**: Very fast (validation in weeks, launch in months)
- **4**: Fast (validation in months, launch in 3-6 months)
- **3**: Moderate (validation in months, launch in 6-12 months)
- **2**: Slow (validation in months, launch in 12-18 months)
- **1**: Very slow (validation in months, launch in 18+ months)

**Time Factors**:
- Validation timeline
- Build timeline
- Time to first revenue
- Time to meaningful MRR

### Portfolio Score Calculation

**Total Score (out of 25)**:
- **Portfolio Priority (20-25)**: Top priority, allocate resources immediately
- **High Priority (15-19)**: High priority, allocate resources when available
- **Medium Priority (10-14)**: Medium priority, validate when capacity allows
- **Low Priority (5-9)**: Low priority, validate only if no better options
- **Kill (0-4)**: Kill immediately, don't waste resources

### Portfolio Prioritization Matrix

**Prioritize by**: Expected Value × (1 - Risk Score/5) × Strategic Fit × (1 - Resource Requirements/5) / Time to Value

**Simplified**: Focus on high EV, low risk, strong strategic fit, low resources, fast time to value.

## Required: Expected Value Modeling

**CRITICAL**: Model expected value for each product bet.

### Expected Value Components

#### Probability of Success
- **Demand validation probability**: [What % chance demand is validated?]
- **Moat/MRR validation probability**: [What % chance moat/MRR plan is validated?]
- **Build success probability**: [What % chance build succeeds?]
- **Market success probability**: [What % chance market success?]
- **Overall probability**: [Combined probability of success]

#### Impact (MRR Potential)
- **Year 1 MRR potential**: [What's the Year 1 MRR potential?]
- **Year 2 MRR potential**: [What's the Year 2 MRR potential?]
- **Year 3 MRR potential**: [What's the Year 3 MRR potential?]
- **Lifetime value**: [What's the lifetime value potential?]

#### Expected Value Calculation
- **EV = Probability × Impact**
- **Example**: 50% probability × $50k Year 1 MRR = $25k EV

### Expected Value Comparison

**Compare products by EV**:
- Product A: $25k EV
- Product B: $15k EV
- Product C: $10k EV

**Prioritize by EV** (all else equal).

## Required: Risk Scoring

**CRITICAL**: Score risk for each product bet.

### Risk Categories

1. **Demand Risk**
   - **Low**: Strong validation signals, clear demand
   - **Medium**: Some validation signals, unclear demand
   - **High**: Weak validation signals, unclear demand

2. **Moat Risk**
   - **Low**: Clear moat strategy, defensible
   - **Medium**: Some moat strategy, partially defensible
   - **High**: Unclear moat strategy, not defensible

3. **Market Risk**
   - **Low**: Growing market, early wave, low competition
   - **Medium**: Stable market, mature wave, moderate competition
   - **High**: Declining market, late wave, high competition

4. **Team Risk**
   - **Low**: Strong team fit, existing expertise
   - **Medium**: Some team fit, learnable expertise
   - **High**: Poor team fit, missing expertise

5. **Technical Risk**
   - **Low**: Simple build, existing infrastructure
   - **Medium**: Moderate build, some new infrastructure
   - **High**: Complex build, new infrastructure

### Risk Score Calculation

**Total Risk Score (out of 25)**:
- **Very Low Risk (20-25)**: Proceed with confidence
- **Low Risk (15-19)**: Proceed with caution
- **Moderate Risk (10-14)**: Proceed with significant caution
- **High Risk (5-9)**: Proceed only if high EV
- **Very High Risk (0-4)**: Kill unless exceptional EV

## Required: Shared Infrastructure Strategy

**CRITICAL**: Design shared infrastructure to lower marginal cost of new products.

### Shared Infrastructure Components

1. **Technical Infrastructure**
   - **What's shared**: [What technical infrastructure is shared?]
   - **Examples**: Auth, billing, database, APIs, monitoring, logging
   - **Cost reduction**: [How much does this reduce cost per product?]

2. **Product Infrastructure**
   - **What's shared**: [What product infrastructure is shared?]
   - **Examples**: Design system, component library, user management, analytics
   - **Cost reduction**: [How much does this reduce cost per product?]

3. **Go-to-Market Infrastructure**
   - **What's shared**: [What GTM infrastructure is shared?]
   - **Examples**: Marketing channels, sales process, customer success, support
   - **Cost reduction**: [How much does this reduce cost per product?]

4. **Operational Infrastructure**
   - **What's shared**: [What operational infrastructure is shared?]
   - **Examples**: Legal, compliance, finance, HR, processes
   - **Cost reduction**: [How much does this reduce cost per product?]

### Infrastructure Investment Strategy

- **When to invest**: [When should we invest in shared infrastructure?]
- **ROI calculation**: [How to calculate ROI on infrastructure?]
- **Prioritization**: [Which infrastructure investments have highest ROI?]

**Example**: Investing in shared auth/billing infrastructure reduces cost per product by 40%, enabling 2.5x more products with same resources.

## Required: "Kill Fast" Diagnostics

**CRITICAL**: Establish clear kill criteria to avoid wasting resources on bad bets.

### Kill Criteria (Kill if any of these are true)

1. **Demand Kill Signals**
   - ❌ No demand validation signals after 3+ tests
   - ❌ Negative feedback from target community
   - ❌ No willingness to pay
   - ❌ No emotional attachment ("would you be upset if it disappeared?" = No)

2. **Moat Kill Signals**
   - ❌ No clear moat strategy possible
   - ❌ No defensibility path
   - ❌ No retention thesis possible
   - ❌ No expansion revenue path

3. **Market Kill Signals**
   - ❌ Declining market wave
   - ❌ High competition, no differentiation
   - ❌ Regulatory risks too high
   - ❌ Market timing wrong (too early or too late)

4. **Resource Kill Signals**
   - ❌ Resource requirements exceed capacity
   - ❌ Opportunity cost too high (better bets available)
   - ❌ Time to value too long
   - ❌ Strategic fit too weak

5. **Portfolio Kill Signals**
   - ❌ Portfolio score too low (< 5)
   - ❌ Expected value too low (< $5k EV)
   - ❌ Risk too high (> 20 risk score)
   - ❌ Better opportunities available

### Kill Process

1. **Identify kill signal**: [What kill signal was triggered?]
2. **Assess kill decision**: [Is kill decision clear?]
3. **Document learnings**: [What did we learn?]
4. **Reallocate resources**: [Where do resources go next?]
5. **Update portfolio**: [Update portfolio prioritization]

## Portfolio Management Rules

### Rule 1: How Many Simultaneous Bets?

**Validation Tier**: 3-5 products simultaneously
- **Rationale**: Enough to have options, not so many that validation is shallow
- **Allocation**: Distribute validation time across bets based on priority

**Engineering Tier**: 1-2 products simultaneously
- **Rationale**: Focus is critical for build success
- **Exception**: Can handle more if team capacity allows

**Growth Tier**: 2-4 products
- **Rationale**: Maintenance mode allows more products
- **Exception**: Depends on team capacity and product complexity

### Rule 2: How to Allocate Validation Time?

**Allocation Formula**: Time = Portfolio Score / Sum of All Portfolio Scores × Total Validation Time

**Example**:
- Product A (Score 20): 20/50 = 40% of validation time
- Product B (Score 15): 15/50 = 30% of validation time
- Product C (Score 10): 10/50 = 20% of validation time
- Product D (Score 5): 5/50 = 10% of validation time

**Minimum Time**: Each product gets minimum 10% of validation time (to avoid complete neglect).

### Rule 3: How to Score Opportunity Cost?

**Opportunity Cost = Best Alternative EV - Current Product EV**

**Example**:
- Current Product EV: $10k
- Best Alternative EV: $25k
- Opportunity Cost: $15k

**Kill if**: Opportunity Cost > Current Product EV × 2

**Example**: If opportunity cost is $15k and current product EV is $10k, kill current product (opportunity cost is 1.5x current EV, but threshold is 2x, so keep for now).

### Rule 4: How Many Should Graduate to Engineering?

**Graduation Criteria**:
- ✅ Portfolio Score ≥ 15 (High Priority or Portfolio Priority)
- ✅ Expected Value ≥ $10k
- ✅ Risk Score ≤ 15 (Low Risk or Very Low Risk)
- ✅ Passed all validation gates (insight, demand, moat/MRR)
- ✅ Engineering capacity available

**Graduation Limit**: 
- **Maximum 2 products** graduate to engineering simultaneously
- **Exception**: Can graduate more if team capacity allows and products are low-resource

**Graduation Process**:
1. Score product on portfolio criteria
2. Verify all validation gates passed
3. Check engineering capacity
4. Compare to other products in portfolio
5. Make graduation decision

## Portfolio Review Process

### Weekly Portfolio Review

**Review all products in portfolio**:
1. Update portfolio scores
2. Check kill signals
3. Reallocate validation time
4. Make graduation decisions
5. Update prioritization

### Monthly Portfolio Review

**Deep portfolio review**:
1. Assess portfolio health
2. Review shared infrastructure investments
3. Analyze portfolio performance
4. Adjust portfolio strategy
5. Make strategic decisions

### Quarterly Portfolio Review

**Strategic portfolio review**:
1. Review portfolio strategy
2. Assess market timing
3. Evaluate infrastructure investments
4. Make portfolio adjustments
5. Plan next quarter

## Quality Gates

Portfolio management is working when:
- ✅ 3-5 products in validation tier
- ✅ 1-2 products in engineering tier
- ✅ Portfolio scores updated weekly
- ✅ Kill decisions made quickly (< 2 weeks after kill signal)
- ✅ Resources allocated by priority
- ✅ Expected value modeled for all products
- ✅ Shared infrastructure reducing marginal cost
- ✅ Portfolio compounding MRR

## Definition of Done

Portfolio management is done when:
- ✅ Portfolio structure defined (tiers, targets)
- ✅ Prioritization framework established
- ✅ Expected value modeling in place
- ✅ Risk scoring system created
- ✅ Shared infrastructure strategy defined
- ✅ Kill-fast diagnostics established
- ✅ Portfolio rules defined (bets, allocation, opportunity cost, graduation)
- ✅ Portfolio review process established
- ✅ Products scored and prioritized
- ✅ Resources allocated by priority

## Critical Rules

1. **No product enters validation without portfolio scoring**
2. **No product graduates to engineering without portfolio prioritization**
3. **Kill fast**: If kill signal triggered, kill within 2 weeks
4. **Prioritize by expected value**: All else equal, prioritize high EV
5. **Manage opportunity cost**: Don't waste resources on low-EV products when high-EV products available
6. **Invest in shared infrastructure**: Lower marginal cost of new products
7. **Review portfolio weekly**: Keep portfolio scores updated and decisions current

**Bottom Line**: Isenberg focuses on one product at a time. But your goal is systematized product creation with multiple bets and continuous MRR compounding. Portfolio management prevents "falling in love with every idea" and ensures resources are allocated to highest-value opportunities.
