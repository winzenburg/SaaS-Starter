# Playbook: Insight Validation (Isenberg Edition)

## Goal
Greg's pre-build validation process encoded step-by-step. Validate demand before building.

## Rule
**No feature enters engineering without passing at least 3 demand-validation tests.**

## Prerequisites
- Raw product/feature idea
- Initial market context
- Willingness to validate before building

**CRITICAL**: Before starting validation, verify idea meets core criteria (`.cursor/rules/000-core-idea-criteria.mdc`):
- Identity-level pain
- Ongoing, recurring need
- Distribution wedge baked in
- Match between insight + community

If criteria not met → pivot or kill. Do not proceed to validation.

## Step Sequence

```
Unfair Insight Brief → Narrative 1-pager → Community Heat Map → 10 Lo-Fi Tests → "Would you be upset?" test → Landing page + waitlist → Manual concierge/MVP → Decision point (Proceed/Pivot/Kill)
```

## Steps

### 1. Unfair Insight Brief
**Input**: Raw product/feature idea  
**Output**: Unfair Insight document

**Agent**: Insight & Narrative Strategist

**Required Artifacts**:
- Insight document in `docs/product/INSIGHT-<product>.md`
- Unfair insight (what do we know that others don't?)
- Target community identification
- Early signals definition
- 5 demand-validation tests (no-code/human first)
- Distribution wedge
- Recommendation (proceed, pivot, or kill)

**Deliverables**:
- Unfair insight documented
- Clear POV ("What problem do we exist to punch in the face?")
- Target community identified
- Early signals defined

**Quality Gate**: Unfair insight must be unique and defensible

### 2. Narrative 1-pager
**Input**: Unfair Insight Brief  
**Output**: Narrative 1-pager

**Agent**: Insight & Narrative Strategist

**Required Artifacts**:
- Narrative document (can be part of Insight Brief)
- Emotional hook
- Transformation story
- Value proposition

**Deliverables**:
- Clear narrative with emotional resonance
- Transformation story (before → after)
- Value proposition articulated

**Quality Gate**: Narrative must have clear emotional hook and transformation story

### 3. Retention Thesis
**Input**: Unfair Insight Brief, Narrative  
**Output**: Retention Thesis document

**Agent**: Product Strategist

**Required Artifacts**:
- Retention Thesis in PRD or separate document
- **Why do users come back weekly/monthly?** (answered)
- **What's the recurring job or frequency driver?** (answered)
- **What habit loop / alert / collaborative ritual keeps usage alive?** (answered)
- Retention mechanics defined (not just acquisition)
- Habit formation strategy
- Recurring value delivery mechanism

**Deliverables**:
- Clear retention thesis documented
- Recurring job identified (why they come back)
- Frequency driver identified (weekly/monthly trigger)
- Habit loop or ritual defined (what keeps usage alive)
- Retention mechanics designed (not just acquisition)

**Quality Gate**: 
- Retention thesis must be clear and specific
- Recurring job must be identified
- Frequency driver must be defined
- Habit loop/ritual must be designed
- **MRR durability = retention architecture** (not just launch)

**Critical Rule**: Many niche products die from "strong launch, weak week-8 retention." Retention must be designed in, not patched later.

### 4. Community Heat Map + Moat Design
**Input**: Unfair Insight Brief, Narrative  
**Output**: Community Heat Analysis + Moat Design

**Agent**: Market Scanner

**Required Artifacts**:
- Community Heat Analysis in `docs/research/market-scan-<feature>.md`
- Identification of niche internet tribes
- Micro-communities to win first
- Pain + activation energy assessment
- Community Heat Map (high/medium/low heat)
- **Moat Design** (at least 2 moat types selected):
  - Data moat (proprietary usage data → better outcomes)
  - Workflow lock-in (deep integration into daily ops)
  - Network effects (value increases with more users)
  - Ecosystem moat (plugins, integrations, templates)
  - Switching costs (migration pain, saved state, team habits)
  - Brand/identity moat (community + narrative)
- Moat implementation plan (how to build each selected moat)

**Deliverables**:
- Communities identified and ranked by heat
- "Which community has the most pain + activation energy?" answered
- "What niche internet tribe desperately wants this?" answered
- "What micro-community can we win first?" answered
- **At least 2 moat types selected and justified**
- **Moat implementation plan for each selected moat**
- **How moats will be built over time (not just community)**

**Quality Gate**: 
- At least one high-heat community identified
- At least 2 moat types selected
- Moat implementation plan created

### 5. 10 Lo-Fi Tests
**Input**: Insight Brief, Narrative, Retention Thesis, Community Heat Map  
**Output**: 10 High-Velocity Tests

**Agent**: Product Strategist

**Required Artifacts**:
- 10 High-Velocity Tests in PRD
- Each test with: name, method, success criteria, timeline
- Tests must be fast and low-cost
- No-code/human first approach

**Deliverables**:
- 10 actionable tests designed
- Success criteria defined for each
- Timeline for running tests
- Tests are runnable without engineering

**Quality Gate**: All 10 tests must be actionable and low-cost

### 6. "Would You Be Upset If This Disappeared?" Test
**Input**: Insight Brief, Narrative, Community Heat Map  
**Output**: Emotional attachment validation

**Agent**: Product Strategist / UX Researcher

**Required Artifacts**:
- Test plan for "Would you be upset?" question

**Output**: Landing page validation results

**Agent**: Product Strategist / Implementer (minimal implementation)

**Required Artifacts**:
- Landing page created (can be simple)
- Waitlist signup mechanism
- Analytics tracking
- Conversion metrics

**Deliverables**:

- Minimum 50 waitlist signups (or 5% conversion rate, whichever is higher)
- Traffic from target community
- Signups indicate genuine interest

### 8. Manual Concierge/MVP Test
**Input**: All previous validation  
**Output**: Manual service validation

**Agent**: Product Strategist / Implementer (manual process)

**Required Artifacts**:
- Manual process for delivering value
- Service delivery mechanism (email, spreadsheet, manual work)

## Quality Gates

Each step must pass quality gates before proceeding:
- **Unfair Insight**: Unique and defensible
- **Narrative**: Clear emotional hook and transformation
- **Retention Thesis**: Recurring job, frequency driver, and habit loop defined
- **Community Heat Map**: High-heat community identified
- **Moat Design**: At least 2 moat types selected with implementation plan
- **10 Lo-Fi Tests**: All actionable and low-cost
- **"Would you be upset?"**: 30%+ would be upset
- **Landing page**: 50+ signups or 5%+ conversion
- **Manual concierge**: 3+ paying customers
- **Decision**: Clear and justified

## Rule Enforcement

**CRITICAL RULE**: No feature enters engineering without passing at least 3 demand-validation tests.

This means:
- If less than 3 tests pass → KILL or PIVOT (do not proceed to engineering)
- If 3+ tests pass → Can proceed to new feature playbook
- Engineering Architect should check validation results before creating ADR
- Implementer should not start building without validation proof

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Building before validating demand
- ❌ Proceeding with less than 3 passed tests
- ❌ Skipping manual concierge test
- ❌ Ignoring "would you be upset?" results
- ❌ Building landing page without measuring results
- ❌ Not identifying high-heat community
- ❌ Proceeding without clear unfair insight

## Next Steps

### If PROCEED
- Move to `.cursor/rules/210-playbook-new-feature.mdc`
- Use validated insight, narrative, and community in PRD
- Reference validation results in PRD

### If PIVOT
- Identify what to pivot (insight, narrative, community, approach)
- Create new validation plan
- Re-run validation tests
- Return to decision point

### If KILL
- Document learnings
- Identify what didn't work
- Consider alternative directions
- Archive validation results for future reference
