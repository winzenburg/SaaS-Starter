# Playbook: Insight Validation (Isenberg Edition)

## Goal
Greg's pre-build validation process encoded step-by-step. Validate demand before building.

## Mental Model: Heat Filter

**"Do a tribe of real humans urgently want this?"**

**Proof**: waitlists, DMs, preorders, repeat usage.

This playbook validates the **Heat Filter** (Isenberg). The **Durability Filter** is validated in `.cursor/rules/205-playbook-moat-mrr-validation.mdc`.

**Heat gets you in. Durability makes it a real SaaS business.**

## Rule
**No feature enters engineering without passing at least 3 demand-validation tests.**

## Prerequisites
- Raw product/feature idea
- Initial market context
- Willingness to validate before building

**CRITICAL**: Before starting validation, verify idea meets core criteria (`.cursor/rules/000-core-idea-criteria.mdc`):
- Identity-level pain
- Ongoing, recurring need
- Distribution wedge baked in
- Match between insight + community

If criteria not met → pivot or kill. Do not proceed to validation.

## Step Sequence

```
Unfair Insight Brief → Narrative 1-pager → Community Heat Map → 10 Lo-Fi Tests → "Would you be upset?" test → Landing page + waitlist → Manual concierge/MVP → Decision point (Proceed/Pivot/Kill)
```

## Steps

### 1. Unfair Insight Brief
**Input**: Raw product/feature idea  
**Output**: Unfair Insight document

**Agent**: Insight & Narrative Strategist

**Required Artifacts**:
- Insight document in `docs/product/INSIGHT-<product>.md`
- Unfair insight (what do we know that others don't?)
- Target community identification
- Early signals definition
- 5 demand-validation tests (no-code/human first)
- Distribution wedge
- Recommendation (proceed, pivot, or kill)

**Deliverables**:
- Unfair insight documented
- Clear POV ("What problem do we exist to punch in the face?")
- Target community identified
- Early signals defined

**Quality Gate**: Unfair insight must be unique and defensible

### 2. Narrative 1-pager
**Input**: Unfair Insight Brief  
**Output**: Narrative 1-pager

**Agent**: Insight & Narrative Strategist

**Required Artifacts**:
- Narrative document (can be part of Insight Brief)
- Emotional hook
- Transformation story
- Value proposition

**Deliverables**:
- Clear narrative with emotional resonance
- Transformation story (before → after)
- Value proposition articulated

**Quality Gate**: Narrative must have clear emotional hook and transformation story

### 3. Monetization Wedge
**Input**: Unfair Insight Brief, Narrative  
**Output**: Monetization Wedge document

**Agent**: Product Strategist / Insight Strategist

**Required Artifacts**:
- Monetization Wedge in PRD or Insight Brief
- **What is the first paid moment?** (answered)
- **What is the natural expansion revenue?** (seats, usage, tiers) (answered)
- **What value metric scales with customer success?** (answered)
- Pricing strategy defined (not just "free to grow")
- Value metric identified (what customers pay for)
- Expansion path defined (how revenue grows)

**Deliverables**:
- Clear first paid moment identified
- Natural expansion revenue path defined
- Value metric that scales with customer success
- Pricing strategy prevents "free audience, no business"
- Monetization wedge designed (not just community growth)

**Quality Gate**: 
- First paid moment must be clear and early
- Natural expansion revenue must be defined
- Value metric must scale with customer success
- **Pricing as product** (not just free to grow)
- **Prevents "free audience, no business"**

**Critical Rule**: Community products often start free/cheap to grow. That's fine for validation, but to get strong MRR you need pricing as product earlier.

### 4. Retention Thesis
**Input**: Unfair Insight Brief, Narrative  
**Output**: Retention Thesis document

**Agent**: Product Strategist

**Required Artifacts**:
- Retention Thesis in PRD or separate document
- **Why do users come back weekly/monthly?** (answered)
- **What's the recurring job or frequency driver?** (answered)
- **What habit loop / alert / collaborative ritual keeps usage alive?** (answered)
- Retention mechanics defined (not just acquisition)
- Habit formation strategy
- Recurring value delivery mechanism

**Deliverables**:
- Clear retention thesis documented
- Recurring job identified (why they come back)
- Frequency driver identified (weekly/monthly trigger)
- Habit loop or ritual defined (what keeps usage alive)
- Retention mechanics designed (not just acquisition)

**Quality Gate**: 
- Retention thesis must be clear and specific
- Recurring job must be identified
- Frequency driver must be defined
- Habit loop/ritual must be designed
- **MRR durability = retention architecture** (not just launch)

**Critical Rule**: Many niche products die from "strong launch, weak week-8 retention." Retention must be designed in, not patched later.

### 5. Durability Filter
**Input**: Unfair Insight Brief, Narrative, Community Heat Map  
**Output**: Durability Assessment

**Agent**: Market Scanner / Product Strategist

**Required Artifacts**:
- Durability Filter scoring in market scan or PRD
- **Frequency of the job** (scored 1-5)
- **Economic buyer has budget** (scored 1-5)
- **Problem exists independent of hype** (scored 1-5)
- **Users would be upset if it disappeared** (scored 1-5)
- **Clear path to switching costs / workflow embed** (scored 1-5)
- Total durability score (out of 25)
- Durability assessment: **Durable Market** | **Cash-Flow Micro-Bet**

**Scoring Criteria**:

#### 1. Frequency of the Job (1-5)
- **5**: Daily/weekly recurring job
- **4**: Monthly recurring job
- **3**: Quarterly recurring job
- **2**: Occasional/seasonal job
- **1**: One-time or rare job

#### 2. Economic Buyer Has Budget (1-5)
- **5**: Budgeted spend, enterprise buyer
- **4**: Budgeted spend, SMB buyer
- **3**: Discretionary spend, but regular
- **2**: Hobby spend, occasional
- **1**: No budget, free only

#### 3. Problem Exists Independent of Hype (1-5)
- **5**: Structural pain, exists regardless of trends
- **4**: Long-term pain, not trend-dependent
- **3**: Pain exists but may be amplified by trends
- **2**: Trend-dependent pain, may fade
- **1**: Purely trend-driven, likely temporary

#### 4. Users Would Be Upset If It Disappeared (1-5)
- **5**: Critical to operations, high emotional attachment
- **4**: Important to workflow, would be missed
- **3**: Useful but replaceable
- **2**: Nice to have, low attachment
- **1**: No attachment, easily forgotten

#### 5. Clear Path to Switching Costs / Workflow Embed (1-5)
- **5**: Deep workflow integration, high switching costs
- **4**: Moderate integration, some switching costs
- **3**: Light integration, minimal switching costs
- **2**: No integration, easy to switch
- **1**: No switching costs, purely transactional

**Durability Assessment**:

#### Durable Market (Score 18-25)
- **Treatment**: Compounding SaaS asset
- **Strategy**: Build for long-term MRR
- **Investment**: Full product development
- **Moat focus**: Structural moats (data, workflow, network effects)

#### Cash-Flow Micro-Bet (Score 10-17)
- **Treatment**: Cash-flow micro-bet, not compounding asset
- **Strategy**: Build for short-term revenue, expect trend fade
- **Investment**: Minimal viable product, fast iteration
- **Moat focus**: Community moat only, expect competition

#### Low Durability (Score 5-9)
- **Treatment**: Consider pivot or kill
- **Strategy**: Not recommended unless strong distribution wedge
- **Investment**: Minimal, validate quickly
- **Moat focus**: None, likely temporary

**Deliverables**:
- Durability scores for all 5 criteria
- Total durability score
- Durability assessment (Durable Market | Cash-Flow Micro-Bet | Low Durability)
- Strategic recommendation based on durability

**Quality Gate**: 
- Durability Filter must be scored
- Assessment must be clear (Durable Market | Cash-Flow Micro-Bet | Low Durability)
- Strategic recommendation must align with durability score

**Critical Rule**: Some niches are trend-spikes, not durable markets. Isenberg is great at catching waves, but defensive moat + enduring MRR requires filtering for structural vs. cyclical pain, recurring workflow vs. novelty, budgeted spend vs. hobby spend.

### 6. Community Heat Map + Moat Design

## Quality Gates

Each step must pass quality gates before proceeding:
- **Unfair Insight**: Unique and defensible
- **Narrative**: Clear emotional hook and transformation
- **Monetization Wedge**: First paid moment, expansion revenue, and value metric defined
- **Durability Filter**: All 5 criteria scored, assessment clear (Durable Market | Cash-Flow Micro-Bet | Low Durability)

## Rule Enforcement

**CRITICAL RULE**: No feature enters engineering without passing at least 3 demand-validation tests.

This means:
- If less than 3 tests pass → KILL or PIVOT (do not proceed to engineering)
- If 3+ tests pass → Can proceed to new feature playbook
- Engineering Architect should check validation results before creating ADR
- Implementer should not start building without validation proof

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Building before validating demand
- ❌ Proceeding with less than 3 passed tests
- ❌ Skipping manual concierge test
- ❌ Ignoring "would you be upset?" results
- ❌ Building landing page without measuring results
- ❌ Not identifying high-heat community
- ❌ Proceeding without clear unfair insight

## Next Steps

### If PROCEED
- Move to `.cursor/rules/210-playbook-new-feature.mdc`
- Use validated insight, narrative, and community in PRD
- Reference validation results in PRD

### If PIVOT
- Identify what to pivot (insight, narrative, community, approach)
- Create new validation plan
- Re-run validation tests
- Return to decision point

### If KILL
- Document learnings
- Identify what didn't work
- Consider alternative directions
- Archive validation results for future reference
