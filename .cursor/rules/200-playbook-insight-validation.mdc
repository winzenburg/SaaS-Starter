# Playbook: Insight Validation (Pre-Build Validation)

**Goal**: Validate desirability, durability, and defensibility before build. Isenberg-style demand validation + moat extensions.

## Why This Playbook Exists

Greg Isenberg's approach validates demand before building. This playbook extends that with durability and defensibility validation to ensure you're building a real SaaS business, not just a feature that people want.

## Prerequisites

- Raw product/feature idea
- Core idea criteria check (`.cursor/rules/000-core-idea-criteria.mdc`)
- Portfolio scoring (`.cursor/rules/207-playbook-portfolio-management.mdc`)

## Step Sequence

```
1. @Insight-Strategist → Unfair Insight Brief
2. @Market-Scanner → Community Heat & Niche Durability
3. @Product-Strategist → Narrative PRD + Desirability Tests
4. @Retention-Architect → Weekly/Monthly Value Design
5. @Moat-MRR-Strategist → Moat Map + Expansion Plan
6. @Portfolio-Prioritizer → Kill/Pivot/Proceed
7. Only if Proceed → handoff to 210-playbook-new-feature
```

## Steps

## Mental Model

**Heat gets you in. Durability makes it a real SaaS business.**

This playbook validates both:
- **Heat Filter (Isenberg)**: "Do a tribe of real humans urgently want this?" (Steps 1-3)
- **Durability Filter**: "Will this still matter and keep paying 12–36 months from now?" (Steps 4-6)

Only ideas that pass both filters proceed to engineering.
