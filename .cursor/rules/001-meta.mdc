# Meta Rules: Memory & Session Hygiene

## Memory Management
- Create memories for project-level decisions, user preferences, domain knowledge, recurring patterns
- Do not create memories for temporary context, code-specific details, one-off decisions
- Review and update memories periodically; remove outdated ones

## Session Hygiene
- Start: Read project rules, check AGENTS.md, review recent changes
- During: Follow guardrails, use playbooks, verify tests pass, make small increments
- End: Verify tests, check linting, update documentation, create clear commits

## Context Management
- Track dependencies, follow workflows, coordinate agents through documentation
- Document decisions in ADRs, update rules when patterns emerge, preserve state with git

## Error Recovery
- Stop and assess when things go wrong
- Check guardrails and playbooks
- Fix systematically, verify tests pass
