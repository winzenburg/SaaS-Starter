## Enforcement

### Pre-Pain Signal Analysis Checks

**Before starting Pain Signal Analysis**:
1. ✅ Niche intelligence document must exist
2. ✅ All 7 tasks must be complete
3. ✅ All quality gates must pass

### Agent Requirements

**@Niche-Intelligence-Agent must**:

2. Complete all 7 tasks
3. Produce structured niche intelligence document
4. Ensure all quality gates pass

## Summary

1. **Inputs**: Manus narrative (required), Manus competitor landscape (required), Pain signals (optional), JTBD (optional)
2. **Tasks**: Identify niche size/psychographics/subcultures, extract vocabulary/identity/cultural norms, map communities, extract frustrations/desires/worldview, identify entry points, document niche segmentation, identify adjacent niches
3. **Output**: `/docs/discovery/NICHE-INTEL-<idea-slug>.md`
4. **Stage Gate**: Cannot proceed to Stage 2 without completing Stage 1

**Niche Intelligence is required before Pain Signal Analysis. It's the foundation of product discovery.**
