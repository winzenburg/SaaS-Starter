# Rule 060: ChatGPT Refinement

> ChatGPT is used to refine, cluster, and structure Manus outputs. See Rule 002 for ChatGPT vs Claude routing.

## Core Principle

**ChatGPT refines Manus outputs by clustering, synthesizing, extracting, and validating. Cursor agents must request ChatGPT refinement when clarity is needed.**

## ChatGPT Refinement Tasks

ChatGPT is used to:

### 1. Cluster Pains into Themes

**Purpose**: Organize pain points into meaningful clusters

**Tasks**:
- Group related pains together
- Identify pain themes and patterns
- Cluster by frequency (Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Event-driven)
- Cluster by severity (Mild/Moderate/Severe/Critical)
- Cluster by urgency (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- Identify "moment of acute pain" (MAAP) patterns

**Input**: Manus pain language dictionary  
**Output**: Clustered pain themes for `@Pain-Signal-Agent`

**Agent**: `@ChatGPT-Reasoning-Agent`

### 2. Extract Underlying Patterns and Motivations

**Purpose**: Identify deeper patterns and motivations behind surface-level insights

**Tasks**:
- Extract underlying motivations from pain language
- Identify behavioral patterns
- Extract psychological drivers
- Identify hidden needs and desires
- Extract systemic patterns

**Input**: Manus pain language, persona narrative, JTBD extraction  
**Output**: Pattern analysis for discovery agents

**Agent**: `@ChatGPT-Reasoning-Agent`

### 3. Refine JTBD Structure

**Purpose**: Structure and organize JTBD into clear hierarchy

**Tasks**:
- Synthesize main job from Manus JTBD extraction
- Identify related jobs that support main job
- Synthesize emotional jobs (how persona wants to feel)
- Classify jobs as ongoing vs discrete
- Map job relationships and hierarchy
- Identify triggers, success criteria, and barriers

**Input**: Manus JTBD extraction, persona narrative  
**Output**: Structured JTBD for `@JTBD-Agent`

**Agent**: `@ChatGPT-Reasoning-Agent`

### 4. Identify Opportunity Vectors

**Purpose**: Extract opportunity vectors from discovery insights

**Tasks**:
- Identify winner-take-most dynamics
- Analyze switching cost potential
- Identify data moat opportunities
- Analyze workflow embedding opportunities
- Identify underserved segments (blue ocean pockets)
- Extract competitive advantages

**Input**: Manus competitor gaps, JTBD, pain signals  
**Output**: Opportunity vectors for `@Opportunity-Moat-Agent`

**Agent**: `@ChatGPT-Reasoning-Agent`

### 5. Cross-Check Competitor Assumptions

**Purpose**: Validate and verify competitor insights

**Tasks**:
- Validate competitor positioning claims
- Cross-check competitor gap assumptions
- Validate differentiation opportunities
- Verify market positioning assumptions
- Validate competitive landscape analysis

**Input**: Manus competitor analysis  
**Output**: Validated competitor insights for discovery agents

**Agent**: `@ChatGPT-Reasoning-Agent`

### 6. Clean Up Ambiguous Data from Manus

**Purpose**: Clarify and structure ambiguous Manus outputs

**Tasks**:
- Resolve ambiguous statements
- Clarify unclear signals
- Structure unstructured data
- Fill in missing context
- Resolve contradictions
- Standardize terminology

**Input**: Ambiguous Manus outputs  
**Output**: Cleaned, structured data for discovery agents

**Agent**: `@ChatGPT-Reasoning-Agent`

## When Cursor Agents Must Request ChatGPT Refinement

**Cursor agents MUST request ChatGPT refinement when:**

### 1. Manus Outputs Contain Unclear Signals

**Triggers**:
- Ambiguous statements in Manus output
- Multiple possible interpretations
- Missing context or details
- Contradictory information
- Unclear pain language
- Vague persona descriptions

**Refinement Request**:
```
@ChatGPT-Reasoning-Agent Clean up ambiguous Manus output.

Input:
- Manus output: [Specific ambiguous output]
- Clarity needed: [What needs clarification]
- Context: [Additional context]

Expected Output:
- [What cleaned output should look like]
```

### 2. Additional Clustering is Needed

**Triggers**:
- Pain points need to be grouped into themes
- Patterns need to be identified
- Categories need to be established
- Priorities need to be determined
- Relationships need to be mapped

**Refinement Request**:
```
@ChatGPT-Reasoning-Agent Cluster pain points into themes.

Input:
- Manus pain language: [Pain language dictionary]
- Clustering needed: [Frequency/Severity/Urgency/Theme]

Expected Output:
- Clustered pain themes with patterns identified
```

### 3. Personas Require Deeper Structuring

**Triggers**:
- Persona narrative needs structuring
- JTBD needs hierarchy
- Emotional drivers need organization
- Motivations need extraction
- Patterns need identification

**Refinement Request**:
```
@ChatGPT-Reasoning-Agent Refine JTBD structure from Manus persona.

Input:
- Manus persona: [Persona narrative]
- Manus JTBD: [JTBD extraction]
- Structuring needed: [Main job/Related jobs/Emotional jobs]

Expected Output:
- Structured JTBD with clear hierarchy
```

## Quality Gates

**ChatGPT refinement must pass quality gates:**

- ✅ **Pains clustered** - All pains grouped into meaningful themes
- ✅ **Patterns extracted** - Underlying patterns and motivations identified
- ✅ **JTBD structured** - Clear hierarchy with main/related/emotional jobs
- ✅ **Opportunities identified** - All opportunity vectors extracted
- ✅ **Assumptions validated** - Competitor assumptions cross-checked
- ✅ **Data cleaned** - Ambiguous data clarified and structured

## Integration with Other Rules

- **Rule 001 (Philosophy)**: AI-assisted discovery mandatory
- **Rule 050 (Manus Integration)**: Manus outputs feed ChatGPT refinement
- **Rule 192 (ChatGPT Integration)**: General ChatGPT usage patterns
- **Rule 300 (Discovery Master)**: ChatGPT refines Manus outputs in discovery
- **Rule 301 (Discovery Overview)**: ChatGPT role in discovery pipeline
- **Rule 320 (ChatGPT Refinement)**: Detailed refinement patterns (discovery-specific)

## Enforcement

### Pre-Discovery Checks

**Before starting discovery**:
1. ✅ Manus outputs must exist
2. ✅ ChatGPT refinement must be requested if clarity is needed

### Pre-Validation Checks

**Before starting validation**:
1. ✅ Pain points must be clustered
2. ✅ JTBD must be structured
3. ✅ Competitor assumptions must be validated

### Agent Requirements

**All discovery and validation agents must**:
1. Request ChatGPT refinement when clarity is needed
2. Use refined outputs in structured documents
3. Attribute ChatGPT refinements appropriately

## Summary

1. **ChatGPT refines Manus outputs** - Clustering, pattern extraction, JTBD structuring, opportunity identification, assumption validation, data cleanup
2. **Cursor agents must request refinement** - When Manus outputs are unclear, clustering is needed, or personas need structuring
3. **Refinement is mandatory** - Cannot skip refinement when clarity is needed
4. **Quality gates enforced** - All refinements must pass quality checks

**ChatGPT refinement is required to ensure clarity, synthesis, and validation of Manus outputs before they're used in structured documents.**
