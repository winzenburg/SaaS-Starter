# Rule: Glif Integration for Creative Batching

## GOAL

Glif is used as a creative acceleration tool for generating batches of:

- Landing page hero images
- UI mockups
- Social content variants
- Paid ad creatives
- Narrative-based visuals
- Simple "micro-tools" for niche validation

## MANDATORY CONDITIONS

- Glif is never a source of truth for system logic.
- Glif workflows must be modular and single-purpose.
- All Glif workflows must accept variables for niche, pain, persona, and desired visual style.
- All content generated must be stored in `/docs/validation/assets/<idea>`.

## AGENT USAGE

The Creative-Batch-Operator agent must:

1. Recommend specific Glif workflows needed based on the idea.
2. Output workflow designs (blocks, variables, connections).
3. Output Glif-ready prompts for each workflow.
4. Output usage instructions for the founder (inputs, outputs, test instructions).

## CONSTRAINTS

- Do not build backend logic in Glif.
- Do not rely on Glif for deterministic tests.
- Treat Glif outputs as drafts; refine via ChatGPT or designer pass.
- Validate all images through Midjourney/Canva if higher polish is required.

## SUCCESS

A Glif workflow is successful if it reduces creative generation time by 80%, enables rapid iteration, and produces assets usable for:

- Landing pages
- Social content
- Paid smoke tests
- Persona storytelling
