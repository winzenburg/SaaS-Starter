# Stack Rule: Expansion Revenue

**Goal**: Ensure every feature defines its expansion revenue mechanism. Pricing is part of product design; not an afterthought.

## Rule

**Each feature must define its expansion revenue mechanism before engineering.**

## Required: Expansion Revenue Mechanism

Every feature must select at least one expansion revenue mechanism:

### 1. Usage-Based
- **How it works**: Revenue grows with usage volume
- **Value metric**: [What usage metric drives revenue?]
- **Pricing tiers**: [What are the usage tiers?]
- **Expansion path**: [How does usage grow over time?]
- **Examples**: API calls, storage, compute, transactions, events

### 2. Seat-Based
- **How it works**: Revenue grows with team size
- **Value metric**: [What seat metric drives revenue?]
- **Pricing tiers**: [What are the seat tiers?]
- **Expansion path**: [How do seats grow over time?]
- **Examples**: User seats, team members, collaborators

### 3. Premium Automation or Analytics
- **How it works**: Revenue grows with advanced features
- **Value metric**: [What premium feature metric drives revenue?]
- **Pricing tiers**: [What are the premium tiers?]
- **Expansion path**: [How do premium features grow over time?]
- **Examples**: Advanced automations, AI insights, predictive analytics, custom workflows

### 4. Add-Ons
- **How it works**: Revenue grows with optional add-on products/services
- **Value metric**: [What add-on metric drives revenue?]
- **Pricing tiers**: [What are the add-on tiers?]
- **Expansion path**: [How do add-ons grow over time?]
- **Examples**: Integrations, compliance features, white-label, custom development

### 5. Organizational Tier Upgrades
- **How it works**: Revenue grows with organizational tier upgrades
- **Value metric**: [What organizational metric drives revenue?]
- **Pricing tiers**: [What are the organizational tiers?]
- **Expansion path**: [How do organizational tiers grow over time?]
- **Examples**: Starter → Pro → Enterprise, Basic → Advanced → Premium

## Expansion Revenue Design

### Expansion Path
- **Initial revenue**: [What's the starting MRR per customer?]
- **Expansion path**: [How does revenue grow?]
- **Target expansion**: [What's the target MRR per customer?]
- **Expansion timeline**: [How long to reach target expansion?]

### Expansion Triggers
- **What triggers expansion?**: [What actions/needs trigger expansion?]
- **When does expansion happen?**: [When does expansion occur naturally?]
- **What prevents expansion?**: [What barriers exist?]

### Expansion Metrics
- **Expansion rate**: [What % of customers expand?]
- **Average expansion**: [What's the average expansion multiple?]
- **Time to expansion**: [How long until first expansion?]

## Pricing Design Principles

**Pricing is part of product design; not an afterthought.**

### Pricing Design Requirements

1. **Pricing must be designed before engineering**
   - Pricing tiers must be defined
   - Value metrics must be identified
   - Expansion path must be clear

2. **Pricing must align with value delivery**
   - Pricing must scale with customer success
   - Value metric must be measurable
   - Expansion must be natural (not forced)

3. **Pricing must enable expansion**
   - Clear expansion triggers
   - Natural expansion path
   - Multiple expansion levers (if possible)

## Quality Gate

**Expansion revenue mechanism must be defined before engineering.**

### Expansion Revenue Checklist

Before any feature enters engineering, verify:

- [ ] At least one expansion revenue mechanism is selected
- [ ] Expansion path is defined (initial → target expansion)
- [ ] Expansion triggers are identified
- [ ] Expansion metrics are defined
- [ ] Pricing tiers are designed
- [ ] Value metric is identified
- [ ] Pricing aligns with value delivery

If expansion revenue mechanism is undefined → do not proceed to engineering. Define expansion revenue mechanism first.

## Rules

- **Expansion revenue is mandatory**: Each feature must define its expansion revenue mechanism
- **At least one mechanism required**: Select at least one expansion revenue type
- **Pricing is product design**: Pricing must be designed before engineering (not an afterthought)
- **Expansion path required**: Clear expansion path from initial to target revenue

## Integration

This rule integrates with:
- `.cursor/rules/004-core-expansion-revenue.mdc` - Core expansion revenue architecture (Layer A)
- `.cursor/rules/027-core-desirability-first.mdc` - Desirability first (Expansion revenue is part of Moat-MRR Strategist gate)
- `.cursor/rules/205-playbook-moat-mrr-validation.mdc` - Moat & MRR validation (includes expansion revenue strategy)
- `docs/agents/moat-mrr-strategist.md` - Moat & MRR Strategist (creates expansion revenue model)
- `docs/agents/product-strategist.md` - Product Strategist (includes monetization wedge)

## Mental Model

**MRR is fragile unless pricing grows with value.**

Every product must include at least one expansion revenue lever. This is how you turn a $29/mo tool into a $290/mo business without acquisition cost. Pricing is not an afterthought—it's a core part of product design that must be considered before engineering begins.

Expansion revenue ensures that as customers succeed, their value (and revenue) grows naturally, creating durable MRR and reducing churn risk.
