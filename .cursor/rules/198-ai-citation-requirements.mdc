# AI Citation Requirements

> All AI-generated content must include proper citations and source attribution

## Rule

**All AI-generated content must include proper citations and source attribution. No claims, data, or insights can be presented without backing sources.**

## Core Principle

**Trust through transparency.** Every claim, statistic, insight, or piece of data generated by AI tools must be traceable to its source. This ensures:

1. **Verifiability**: Users can verify claims independently
2. **Credibility**: Content is backed by real research, not hallucinations
3. **Accountability**: Sources can be reviewed and validated
4. **Quality**: Forces AI tools to use real data, not fabricate information

## Citation Requirements by Tool

### Manus.im Outputs

**Required Citations For**:
- ✅ Niche narrative claims (culture, vocabulary, trends)
- ✅ Pain language quotes (direct quotes from forums, interviews)
- ✅ Persona insights (identity, motivations, emotional drivers)
- ✅ Competitor analysis (positioning, pricing, features)
- ✅ Pricing expectations (market data, surveys)
- ✅ Distribution insights (community data, engagement metrics)

**Citation Format**:
```markdown
[^1]: Source Name. (Date). *Title*. Publication. - https://example.com/article
```

**Sources Section**:
- Must appear at end of document
- All citations numbered sequentially
- URLs included when available
- Date accessed included

### ChatGPT Outputs

**Required Citations For**:
- ✅ Market data and statistics
- ✅ Industry trends and analysis
- ✅ Competitive intelligence
- ✅ User research insights
- ✅ Pricing benchmarks
- ✅ Any factual claims

**Citation Format**:
- Use `[^number]` footnotes in text
- Sources section at end
- Include URLs when available

### All AI Tools

**General Requirements**:
- ✅ Every claim must have a citation
- ✅ Every statistic must have a source
- ✅ Every insight must be traceable
- ✅ No unsupported claims allowed

## Citation Format Standards

### In-Text Citations

**Format**: `[^number]` (footnote notation)

**Example**:
```markdown
Startups value solutions that work on day one [^1]. The market shows a 30-50% increase in efficiency [^2].
```

### Sources Section

**Location**: End of document, before metadata

**Format**:
```markdown
## Sources & Citations

[^1]: Moreno Celta, R. (2025). *Design System Trends*. Design Systems Collective. - https://example.com/article
[^2]: Autentika. (2024, June 18). *Design System Efficiency Study*. - https://example.com/study
```

**Required Elements**:
- Citation number `[^number]`
- Author/Organization name
- Publication date
- Title (italicized)
- Publication/Source name
- URL (when available)
- Date accessed (optional but recommended)

## Parsing and Formatting

### Using the Parser Utility

**For Manus Discovery Packs**:
```typescript
import { parseManusDiscoveryPack, extractSources, formatCitations } from "@/lib/ai-tools/manus-parser";

// Parse discovery pack
const parsed = parseManusDiscoveryPack(markdownContent);

// Extract sources
const sources = extractSources(markdownContent);

// Format citations in text ([1] → [^1])
const formattedText = formatCitations(text, sources);

// Generate sources section
const sourcesSection = generateSourcesSection(sources);
```

**The parser**:
- ✅ Extracts all sources from References section
- ✅ Converts `[number]` to `[^number]` footnotes
- ✅ Generates formatted sources section
- ✅ Preserves URLs and metadata

## Quality Gates

### Citation Quality Checks

**Before Using AI Output**:
1. ✅ All claims have citations
2. ✅ Citations are properly formatted
3. ✅ Sources section is complete
4. ✅ URLs are accessible (when available)
5. ✅ No unsupported claims present

### Validation Process

**Automated Checks**:
- Citation format is correct (`[^number]`)
- Sources section exists
- All in-text citations have corresponding sources
- No orphaned citations

**Manual Review**:
- Sources are relevant and credible
- URLs are valid and accessible
- Citations support the claims made
- No fabricated or hallucinated sources

## Enforcement

### Pre-Generation Requirements

**Before generating AI content**:
1. ✅ Prompt must request citations
2. ✅ System prompt must emphasize source attribution
3. ✅ Tool must be configured to return sources

### Post-Generation Requirements

**After generating AI content**:
1. ✅ Parse and extract all sources
2. ✅ Format citations properly
3. ✅ Generate sources section
4. ✅ Validate all claims have citations
5. ✅ Verify sources are accessible

### Agent Requirements

**All agents using AI tools must**:
1. Request citations in prompts
2. Parse and format citations
3. Include sources section in outputs
4. Validate citation quality
5. Reject outputs without proper citations

## Integration with Other Rules

- **Rule 050 (Manus Integration)**: Manus outputs must include citations
- **Rule 190 (AI Tool Integrations)**: All AI tools must support citations
- **Rule 196 (AI Quality Control)**: Citation quality is a quality gate
- **Rule 310 (Manus in Discovery)**: Discovery outputs must cite sources

## Examples

### Good Citation Example

```markdown
## Niche Narrative

Startups value solutions that work on day one [^1]. The market shows a 30-50% increase in efficiency when using design systems [^2].

## Sources & Citations

[^1]: Moreno Celta, R. (2025). *Design System Trends*. Design Systems Collective. - https://example.com/article
[^2]: Autentika. (2024, June 18). *Design System Efficiency Study*. - https://example.com/study
```

### Bad Citation Example

```markdown
## Niche Narrative

Startups value solutions that work on day one. The market shows a 30-50% increase in efficiency.

<!-- No citations! This is not allowed. -->
```

## Summary

1. **All AI-generated content must include citations** - No exceptions
2. **Citation format**: `[^number]` footnotes with sources section
3. **Parser utility**: Use `manus-parser.ts` for parsing and formatting
4. **Quality gates**: Validate citations before using outputs
5. **Enforcement**: Agents must request, parse, and include citations
6. **Trust through transparency**: Every claim must be traceable

**No AI-generated content is complete without proper citations and source attribution.**
