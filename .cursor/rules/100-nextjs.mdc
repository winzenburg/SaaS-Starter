# Next.js App Router Rules

## Directory Structure
- App Router only: `src/app/` directory structure exclusively
- No Pages Router patterns or file conventions
- Routes in `src/app/(app)/*` import UI from `src/features/*`
- No duplicated UI - all UI components live in feature modules

## Components
- Server Components by default
- Mark client components with `"use client"` only when needed
- Keep client components minimal and focused

## Routes
- Route handlers: `src/app/api/**/route.ts` for API endpoints
- Server actions preferred over client mutations
- Use Next.js metadata API for SEO

## Performance
- Use Next.js Image component for images
- Use Next.js font optimization
- Code splitting automatic with App Router
