# Playbook: New Feature

## Prerequisites
**CRITICAL**: This playbook assumes insight validation is complete. See `.cursor/rules/200-playbook-insight-validation.mdc`.

**Required before starting**:
- ✅ At least 3 demand-validation tests passed
- ✅ Unfair Insight Brief validated
- ✅ Narrative 1-pager created with emotional hook
- ✅ Community Heat Map identifies high-heat community
- ✅ Decision to PROCEED (not PIVOT or KILL)

**Rule**: No feature enters engineering without passing at least 3 demand-validation tests (see `.cursor/rules/027-core-desirability-first.mdc`).

## Step Sequence

```
Insight → Narrative → Validation (must complete first):
1. Insight-Strategist → Unfair Insight
2. Product-Strategist → Narrative + Desirability PRD
3. Market-Scanner → Community Heat + Moat
4. Run Validation Tests (emails, DMs, landing page, "would you be upset?", manual concierge)
5. Green-light decision

If green-light → Architecture Phase:
6. IA Designer → flows/edge cases (parallel OK)
7. Engineering Architect → ADR + schema + router plan
8. Test Engineer → test plan + stubs
9. Implementer → build (small diffs, MVP-first)
10. Accessibility Agent → a11y audit + fix loop
11. Test Engineer → test verify
12. Product Strategist → PRD acceptance check
```

**Note**: Steps 1-5 should follow `.cursor/rules/200-playbook-insight-validation.mdc` if not already completed.

## Steps

## Validation Phase: Demand Before Code

### 1. Insight-Strategist → Unfair Insight
**Input**: Raw product/feature idea  
**Output**: Unfair Insight document

**Agent**: Insight & Narrative Strategist

**Required Artifacts**:
- Insight document in `docs/product/INSIGHT-<product>.md`
- Unfair insight (what do we know that others don't?)
- Clear POV ("What problem do we exist to punch in the face?")
- Target community identification
- Early signals definition
- 5 demand-validation tests (no-code/human first)
- Distribution wedge
- Recommendation (proceed, pivot, or kill)

**Deliverables**:
- Unfair insight documented
- Clear POV articulated
- Target community identified
- Early signals defined
- Demand-validation tests designed
- Distribution wedge identified
- Clear recommendation (proceed/pivot/kill)

**Quality Gate**: Unfair insight must be unique and defensible. Only proceed if recommendation is PROCEED.

### 2. Product-Strategist → Narrative + Desirability PRD
**Input**: Unfair Insight Brief  
**Output**: Narrative + Demand-Driven PRD

**Agent**: Product Strategist

**Required Artifacts**:
- PRD document in `docs/product/PRD-<feature>.md`
- Value Story (central to Greg's playbook)
- Why Now (timing rationale)
- Narrative 1-pager (emotional hook + transformation story)
- Early adopter profile (community, identity, motivation)
- "If users love this, what will they tell friends?"
- Distribution from Day 1
- 10 High-Velocity Tests
- Lo-Fi Validation Plan (email, landing page, Loom demo, tweet test, DM conversations)
- Success metrics (leading/lagging)
- Risks + mitigations

**Deliverables**:
- Value Story crafted
- Why Now justified
- Narrative with emotional hook
- Early adopter profile defined
- Word-of-mouth message identified
- Distribution from Day 1 planned
- 10 High-Velocity Tests designed
- Lo-Fi Validation Plan created
- Desirability validated (not just buildability)

**Quality Gate**: PRD must validate desirability before buildability. Value Story and Why Now are required.

### 3. Monetization Wedge
**Input**: PRD, Narrative  
**Output**: Monetization Wedge

**Agent**: Product Strategist

**Required Artifacts**:
- Monetization Wedge in PRD
- **What is the first paid moment?** (answered)
- **What is the natural expansion revenue?** (seats, usage, tiers) (answered)
- **What value metric scales with customer success?** (answered)
- Pricing strategy defined (not just "free to grow")
- Value metric identified (what customers pay for)
- Expansion path defined (how revenue grows)

**Deliverables**:
- Clear first paid moment identified
- Natural expansion revenue path defined
- Value metric that scales with customer success
- Pricing strategy prevents "free audience, no business"
- Monetization wedge designed (not just community growth)

**Quality Gate**: 
- First paid moment must be clear and early
- Natural expansion revenue must be defined
- Value metric must scale with customer success
- **Pricing as product** (not just free to grow)
- **Prevents "free audience, no business"**

**Critical Rule**: Community products often start free/cheap to grow. That's fine for validation, but to get strong MRR you need pricing as product earlier.

### 4. Retention Thesis
**Input**: PRD, Narrative  
**Output**: Retention Thesis

**Agent**: Product Strategist

**Required Artifacts**:
- Retention Thesis in PRD
- **Why do users come back weekly/monthly?** (answered)
- **What's the recurring job or frequency driver?** (answered)
- **What habit loop / alert / collaborative ritual keeps usage alive?** (answered)
- Retention mechanics defined (not just acquisition)
- Habit formation strategy
- Recurring value delivery mechanism

**Deliverables**:
- Clear retention thesis documented
- Recurring job identified (why they come back)
- Frequency driver identified (weekly/monthly trigger)
- Habit loop or ritual defined (what keeps usage alive)
- Retention mechanics designed (not just acquisition)

**Quality Gate**: 
- Retention thesis must be clear and specific
- Recurring job must be identified
- Frequency driver must be defined
- Habit loop/ritual must be designed
- **MRR durability = retention architecture** (not just launch)

**Critical Rule**: Many niche products die from "strong launch, weak week-8 retention." Retention must be designed in, not patched later.

### 5. Durability Filter
**Input**: PRD, Community Heat Map  
**Output**: Durability Assessment

**Agent**: Market Scanner / Product Strategist

**Required Artifacts**:
- Durability Filter scoring in PRD or market scan
- **Frequency of the job** (scored 1-5)
- **Economic buyer has budget** (scored 1-5)
- **Problem exists independent of hype** (scored 1-5)
- **Users would be upset if it disappeared** (scored 1-5)
- **Clear path to switching costs / workflow embed** (scored 1-5)
- Total durability score (out of 25)
- Durability assessment: **Durable Market** | **Cash-Flow Micro-Bet** | **Low Durability**

**Scoring Criteria** (same as insight validation playbook):
- Frequency of the job (1-5)
- Economic buyer has budget (1-5)
- Problem exists independent of hype (1-5)
- Users would be upset if it disappeared (1-5)
- Clear path to switching costs / workflow embed (1-5)

**Durability Assessment**:
- **Durable Market (18-25)**: Compounding SaaS asset, build for long-term MRR
- **Cash-Flow Micro-Bet (10-17)**: Cash-flow micro-bet, build for short-term revenue, expect trend fade
- **Low Durability (5-9)**: Consider pivot or kill

**Strategic Recommendation**:
- If **Durable Market**: Full product development, structural moats, long-term investment
- If **Cash-Flow Micro-Bet**: Minimal viable product, fast iteration, community moat only, expect competition
- If **Low Durability**: Minimal investment, validate quickly, likely pivot or kill

**Quality Gate**: 
- Durability Filter must be scored
- Assessment must be clear
- Strategic recommendation must align with durability score

**Critical Rule**: Some niches are trend-spikes, not durable markets. Filter for structural vs. cyclical pain, recurring workflow vs. novelty, budgeted spend vs. hobby spend.

### 6. Market-Scanner → Community Heat + Moat Design
**Input**: Insight Brief, PRD, Durability Assessment  
**Output**: Community Heat Analysis + Moat Design

**Agent**: Market Scanner

**Required Artifacts**:
- Community Heat Analysis in `docs/research/market-scan-<feature>.md`
- Community Heat Map (high/medium/low heat communities)
- "Which community has the most pain + activation energy?" answered
- "What niche internet tribe desperately wants this?" answered
- "What micro-community can we win first?" answered
- "Where does this product naturally spread? Why?" answered
- **Moat Design** (at least 2 moat types selected):
  - Data moat (proprietary usage data → better outcomes)
  - Workflow lock-in (deep integration into daily ops)
  - Network effects (value increases with more users)
  - Ecosystem moat (plugins, integrations, templates)
  - Switching costs (migration pain, saved state, team habits)
  - Brand/identity moat (community + narrative)
- **Moat implementation plan** (how to build each selected moat over time)
- Top 3 direct competitors (secondary)
- Switching costs + lock-in analysis

**Deliverables**:
- High-heat communities identified
- **At least 2 moat types selected and justified**
- **Moat implementation plan for each selected moat**
- **How moats will be built over time (not just community)**
- Natural distribution patterns identified
- Community entry points defined
- Competitor analysis (secondary to community)

**Quality Gate**: 
- At least one high-heat community identified
- **At least 2 moat types selected**
- **Moat implementation plan created**
- **Moat design goes beyond community (structural defensibility)**
