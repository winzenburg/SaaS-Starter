# Playbook: Moat & MRR Validation

## Goal
Validate defensibility and monetization before building. Ensure every product/feature has a clear retention thesis and monetization wedge before engineering begins.

## Mental Model: Durability Filter

**"Will this still matter and keep paying 12–36 months from now?"**

**Proof**: recurring job, budgeted buyer, retention loop, moat map.

This playbook validates the **Durability Filter**. The **Heat Filter** (Isenberg) is validated in `.cursor/rules/200-playbook-insight-validation.mdc`.

**Heat gets you in. Durability makes it a real SaaS business.**

## Rule
**No product/feature graduates to engineering without (a) desirability signal and (b) a retention + monetization wedge.**

## Prerequisites
- Insight/Narrative Brief completed (`/docs/product/INSIGHT-<product>.md`)
- Demand validation completed (Greg style - at least 3 tests passed)
- Durability Filter scored and assessed

**CRITICAL**: This playbook runs AFTER insight validation (`.cursor/rules/200-playbook-insight-validation.mdc`) but BEFORE new feature development (`.cursor/rules/210-playbook-new-feature.mdc`).

## Step Sequence

```
Insight/Narrative Brief → Demand Validation (Greg style) → Moat + Retention + Monetization Plan → PRD/ADR/Tests/Build
```

## Steps

### 1. Insight/Narrative Brief Review
**Input**: Insight Brief from Insight & Narrative Strategist  
**Output**: Confirmed insight and narrative

**Required Artifacts**:
- Insight Brief exists (`/docs/product/INSIGHT-<product>.md`)
- Unfair insight validated
- Narrative with emotional hook
- Target community identified
- Durability Filter scored
- Recurring job + budgeted buyer confirmed

**Quality Gate**: 
- Insight Brief must exist and be validated
- Durability Filter must be scored
- Recurring job must be identified
- Budgeted buyer must be confirmed

### 2. Demand Validation (Greg Style)
**Input**: Insight Brief, validation test results  
**Output**: Confirmed desirability signal

**Required Artifacts**:
- At least 3 demand-validation tests passed (from insight validation playbook)
- "Would you be upset if this disappeared?" test results
- Landing page + waitlist test results
- Manual concierge/MVP test results
- Community Heat Map shows high-heat community
- Emotional attachment validated

**Quality Gate**: 
- At least 3 demand-validation tests must have passed
- Clear desirability signal confirmed
- High-heat community identified
- Emotional attachment validated (30%+ would be upset)

**Critical Rule**: **No product/feature graduates to engineering without desirability signal.**

### 3. Moat + Retention + Monetization Plan
**Input**: Insight Brief, Demand Validation Results, Durability Assessment  
**Output**: Moat & MRR Strategy document

**Agent**: Moat & MRR Strategist

**Required Artifacts**:
- Moat & MRR Strategy document (`/docs/product/MOAT-MRR-<product>.md`)
- **Data Moat Thesis** (REQUIRED: proprietary data, compounding mechanism, 10× value, feedback loop)
- **Network Effects or Collaboration Loops** (REQUIRED: at least one collaboration or shared value mechanic)
- **Moat map** (2+ types selected with implementation plan, Data Moat and Network Effects strongly recommended)
- **JTBD Frequency Modeling** (REQUIRED: frequency map, job triggers, frequency increase factors, frequency boosters if rare)
- **Retention thesis** (habit/frequency driver)
- **Expansion Revenue Strategy** (REQUIRED: at least one expansion revenue lever: usage-based, seats, add-ons, premium automations, AI insights, compliance/integrations, advanced analytics, custom workflows)
- **Churn risks & counter-features**
- **Lifecycle state machine**
- **Activation → habit → expansion plan**
- **Churn-prevention triggers**

**Deliverables**:
- **Data Moat Thesis completed** (proprietary data, compounding mechanism, 10× value, feedback loop)
- **Network Effects or Collaboration Loops defined** (at least one collaboration or shared value mechanic selected)
- At least 2 moat types mapped with implementation plan (Data Moat and Network Effects strongly recommended)
- **JTBD Frequency Modeling completed** (frequency map defined, job triggers identified, frequency increase factors defined, frequency boosters selected if job is rare)
- Clear retention thesis (habit/frequency driver)
- **Expansion Revenue Strategy completed** (at least one expansion revenue lever selected, expansion path defined, expansion triggers natural, expansion metrics measurable)
- Churn risks identified with counter-features
- Lifecycle state machine designed
- Activation → habit → expansion plan created
- Churn-prevention triggers defined

**Quality Gate**: 
- **Data Moat Thesis must be complete** (proprietary data, compounding mechanism, 10× value, feedback loop)
- **Network Effects or Collaboration Loops must be defined** (at least one collaboration or shared value mechanic selected)
- Moat map must include at least 2 moat types (Data Moat and Network Effects strongly recommended)
- **JTBD Frequency Modeling must be complete** (frequency map defined, job triggers identified, frequency increase factors defined, frequency boosters selected if job is rare)
- Retention thesis must be clear (habit/frequency driver)
- **Expansion Revenue Strategy must be complete** (at least one expansion revenue lever selected, expansion path defined, expansion triggers natural, expansion metrics measurable)
- Lifecycle state machine must be complete
- Churn-prevention triggers must be defined

**Critical Rule**: **No product/feature graduates to engineering without retention + monetization wedge.**

### 4. Gate Decision: Proceed to PRD/ADR/Tests/Build

**Input**: All validation results (desirability + moat/MRR plan)  
**Output**: Go/No-Go decision

**Decision Criteria**:

#### Green-Light (PROCEED) if:

#### Yellow-Light (PIVOT) if:
- ⚠️ Desirability signal weak (less than 3 tests passed)
- ⚠️ Retention thesis unclear
- ⚠️ Monetization wedge undefined
- ⚠️ Moat map incomplete

## Rule Enforcement

**CRITICAL RULE**: No product/feature graduates to engineering without (a) desirability signal and (b) a retention + monetization wedge.

This means:
- If desirability signal is weak → PIVOT or KILL (do not proceed to engineering)
- If retention thesis is unclear → PIVOT or KILL (do not proceed to engineering)
- If monetization wedge is undefined → PIVOT or KILL (do not proceed to engineering)
- If moat map is incomplete → PIVOT or KILL (do not proceed to engineering)
- Engineering Architect should check Moat & MRR Strategy before creating ADR
- Implementer should not start building without retention + monetization wedge

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Building before validating retention + monetization
- ❌ Proceeding with weak desirability signal
- ❌ Skipping moat map
- ❌ Ignoring retention thesis
- ❌ Building without monetization wedge
- ❌ Not designing lifecycle state machine
- ❌ Proceeding without churn-prevention triggers

## Next Steps

### If PROCEED
- Move to `.cursor/rules/210-playbook-new-feature.mdc`
- Use validated insight, narrative, and community in PRD
- Reference Moat & MRR Strategy in PRD
- Engineering Architect should reference Moat & MRR Strategy in ADR

### If PIVOT
- Identify what to pivot (insight, narrative, community, retention, monetization)
- Create new validation plan
- Re-run validation tests
- Return to gate decision

### If KILL
- Document learnings
- Identify what didn't work
- Consider alternative directions
- Archive validation results for future reference

## Integration with Other Playbooks

### Before This Playbook
- `.cursor/rules/200-playbook-insight-validation.mdc` - Must complete first
  - Insight/Narrative Brief created
  - Demand validation tests executed
  - Durability Filter scored

### After This Playbook
- `.cursor/rules/210-playbook-new-feature.mdc` - Can proceed if green-light
  - PRD creation
  - ADR creation
  - Test planning
  - Implementation

## Workflow Summary

1. **Review Insight/Narrative Brief** (from Insight & Narrative Strategist)
2. **Confirm Demand Validation** (at least 3 tests passed)
3. **Create Moat + Retention + Monetization Plan** (Moat & MRR Strategist)
4. **Gate Decision** (PROCEED | PIVOT | KILL)
5. **If PROCEED**: Move to new feature playbook
6. **If PIVOT**: Return to validation with adjustments
7. **If KILL**: Document learnings and archive

## Critical Success Factors

- **Desirability signal must be strong** (at least 3 tests passed)
- **Retention thesis must be clear** (habit/frequency driver)
- **Monetization wedge must be defined** (first paid moment, expansion revenue, value metric)
- **Moat map must be complete** (2+ types with implementation plan)
- **Lifecycle state machine must be designed** (before coding)
- **Churn-prevention triggers must be defined** (before coding)

## Notes

- This playbook ensures defensibility and monetization are validated before engineering
- It prevents building features that have demand but no retention or monetization path
- It forces explicit moat strategy before building
- It ensures lifecycle loops are designed before coding
- It prevents "free audience, no business" scenarios
