# Core Security

Goal: Avoid common SaaS security footguns.

- Never log secrets or PII
- All server actions/tRPC procedures enforce auth + RBAC
- Tenant scoping required on any org data; no "naked" table reads
- Use parameterized DB queries only
- Validate input before use
- If touching auth/billing/tenancy/export → ADR required
- Webhook signatures must be verified (Stripe, etc.)
- Rate limiting on public endpoints
- CSRF protection on state-changing operations
- Sanitize user input before rendering
- **Enterprise-readiness primitives** (baked in, even if dormant):
  - RBAC scaffolding (roles, permissions, enforcement)
  - Rate limiting infrastructure
  - Audit log table for compliance
  - Export/delete flows for data portability and GDPR
  - Security and abuse controls
