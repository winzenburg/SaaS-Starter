# Manus.im: Narrative Generation Template

## Purpose

Generate compelling product narratives that connect identity-level pain to solution.

## Template

```
Create a compelling narrative for [PRODUCT] targeting [NICHE].

Core pain point: [PAIN_POINT]
Identity-level motivation: [IDENTITY_MOTIVATION]
Solution: [SOLUTION]

Generate 5 narrative variations that:
1. Connect identity-level pain to solution
2. Are emotionally compelling and memorable
3. Have clear value proposition
4. Are ready for validation testing

Select the strongest narrative and explain why.
```

## Variables

- `[PRODUCT]` - Product name (e.g., "Enterprise Design System")
- `[NICHE]` - Target niche (e.g., "Startups, CTOs, Heads of Product")
- `[PAIN_POINT]` - Core pain point (e.g., "Inconsistent UI development slows shipping")
- `[IDENTITY_MOTIVATION]` - Identity-level motivation (e.g., "CTO wants to be seen as a leader who ships fast")
- `[SOLUTION]` - Proposed solution (e.g., "Design system platform that ensures consistency")

## Example

```
Create a compelling narrative for Enterprise Design System targeting Startups, CTOs, Heads of Product.

Core pain point: Inconsistent UI development slows shipping and creates technical debt
Identity-level motivation: CTO wants to be seen as a leader who ships fast and maintains quality
Solution: Design system platform that ensures UI consistency and speeds development

Generate 5 narrative variations that:
1. Connect identity-level pain to solution
2. Are emotionally compelling and memorable
3. Have clear value proposition
4. Are ready for validation testing

Select the strongest narrative and explain why.
```

## Tips

1. **Be specific about identity** - Not just functional pain, but identity-level motivation
2. **Include emotional elements** - Narratives should resonate emotionally
3. **Request variations** - Multiple options help find the best narrative
4. **Ask for selection** - Get reasoning for why one narrative is strongest
