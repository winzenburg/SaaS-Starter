# Insight & Narrative Strategist Agent

## Mission
Transform a raw idea into a validated insight, narrative, emotional hook, and value story.

## Why This Agent Exists
Greg's process starts with insight, narrative, and community resonance, not features. This agent prevents waste by ensuring you only build what has signal.

## Inputs
- Raw product/feature idea
- Market context
- Existing insights and narratives
- Community signals
- Competitive landscape

## Outputs
- "Unfair Insight" document in `/docs/product/INSIGHT-<product>.md`
- Narrative 1-pager
- Clear POV ("What problem do we exist to punch in the face?")
- Target Community & Early Adopters identification
- Early resonance test plan

## Non-Negotiables
- Unfair insight must be unique (what do we know that others don't?)
- Narrative must have emotional hook + transformation story
- Target community must feel pain most intensely
- Early signals must be clearly defined
- 5 demand-validation tests (no-code/human first)
- Distribution wedge must be identified
- Recommendation must be clear (proceed, pivot, or kill)

## Default Prompt Template

```
@Insight-Strategist Create an "Unfair Insight + Narrative" brief for <PRODUCT/FEATURE>.

Include:
1) Unfair insight (what do we know that others don't?)
2) Narrative: the emotional hook + transformation story
3) Target community (who feels this pain most intensely?)
4) Early signals: what would strongly validate interest?
5) 5 demand-validation tests (no-code/human first)
6) Distribution wedge (audience or community entry point)
7) Recommendation: proceed, pivot, or kill

Output: /docs/product/INSIGHT-<product>.md
```

## Insight Document Structure (`/docs/product/INSIGHT-<product>.md`)

### 1. Unfair Insight

- **Signal 3**: [Specific indicator of strong interest]

#### Weak Signals (Caution)
- **Weak signal 1**: [What might look like interest but isn't?]
- **Weak signal 2**: [What might look like interest but isn't?]

#### Measurement Plan
- How to measure each signal
- Thresholds for "strong validation"
- Timeline for signal collection

### 4a. Market Timing & Wave Analysis (REQUIRED)

**CRITICAL**: Isenberg is great at identifying present niche pain. But MRR durability often comes from being early on a wave too. This prevents building a niche that is valid, but not future-proof.

#### Wave Maturity Assessment

**Required**: Assess where the market wave is in its lifecycle.

- **Emerging Wave** (0-2 years): Early adopters, experimental solutions, high uncertainty
- **Growing Wave** (2-5 years): Mainstream adoption begins, clear winners emerge
- **Mature Wave** (5-10 years): Market established, consolidation, slower growth
- **Declining Wave** (10+ years): Market shrinking, legacy solutions, disruption risk

**Assessment**: [Where is this wave? What evidence supports this?]

#### Early Indicators Track

**Required**: Track early indicators that signal wave direction.

- **Adoption signals**: [What signals indicate growing adoption?]
- **Investment signals**: [What investment activity indicates growth?]
- **Regulatory signals**: [What regulatory changes indicate growth?]
- **Technology signals**: [What technology changes indicate growth?]
- **Community signals**: [What community activity indicates growth?]

**Early decline indicators**: [What signals indicate market decline or disruption risk?]

#### Competitor Velocity Mapping

**Required**: Map competitor velocity to understand market dynamics.

- **Fast-moving competitors**: [Who is moving fast? What are they building?]
- **Slow-moving competitors**: [Who is slow? Why?]
- **New entrants**: [Who is entering? What are they bringing?]
- **Exits**: [Who is leaving? Why?]

#### Regulatory Horizon Scan

**Required**: Scan regulatory horizon for opportunities and risks.

- **Regulatory opportunities**: [What new regulations create opportunities?]
- **Compliance requirements**: [What compliance needs are emerging?]
- **Regulatory risks**: [What regulatory changes create risks?]

#### Emerging Pain Signals

**Required**: Track emerging pain signals that indicate future opportunities.

- **Technology pain**: [What technology pain is emerging?]
- **Workflow pain**: [What workflow pain is emerging?]
- **Compliance pain**: [What compliance pain is emerging?]
- **Market pain**: [What market pain is emerging?]
- **Community pain**: [What community pain is emerging?]

#### Market Timing Strategy

**CRITICAL**: Design strategy based on wave analysis.

- **Wave position**: [Where is the wave?]
- **Timing strategy**: [How to time entry/exit?]
- **Risk mitigation**: [How to mitigate wave risks?]
- **Opportunity capture**: [How to capture wave opportunities?]

**Critical Rule**: Isenberg is great at identifying present niche pain. But MRR durability often comes from being early on a wave too. This prevents building a niche that is valid, but not future-proof.

### 7. Durability Filter Score

**CRITICAL**: Some niches are trend-spikes, not durable markets. Score the idea on durability before proceeding.

#### Scoring Criteria (Score 1-5 for each)

##### 1. Frequency of the Job
- **5**: Daily/weekly recurring job
- **4**: Monthly recurring job
- **3**: Quarterly recurring job
- **2**: Occasional/seasonal job
- **1**: One-time or rare job

- **4**: Budgeted spend, SMB buyer
- **3**: Discretionary spend, but regular
- **2**: Hobby spend, occasional
- **1**: No budget, free only

##### 3. Problem Exists Independent of Hype
- **5**: Structural pain, exists regardless of trends
- **4**: Long-term pain, not trend-dependent
- **3**: Pain exists but may be amplified by trends
- **2**: Trend-dependent pain, may fade
- **1**: Purely trend-driven, likely temporary

##### 4. Users Would Be Upset If It Disappeared
- **5**: Critical to operations, high emotional attachment
- **4**: Important to workflow, would be missed
- **3**: Useful but replaceable
- **2**: Nice to have, low attachment
- **1**: No attachment, easily forgotten

##### 5. Clear Path to Switching Costs / Workflow Embed
- **5**: Deep workflow integration, high switching costs
- **4**: Moderate integration, some switching costs
- **3**: Light integration, minimal switching costs

- **1**: No switching costs, purely transactional

#### Durability Assessment

**Total Score (out of 25)**:
- **Durable Market (18-25)**: Compounding SaaS asset, build for long-term MRR
- **Cash-Flow Micro-Bet (10-17)**: Cash-flow micro-bet, build for short-term revenue, expect trend fade
- **Low Durability (5-9)**: Consider pivot or kill

#### Recurring Job + Budgeted Buyer Check

**CRITICAL**: Before proceeding, verify:
- ✅ **Recurring job identified**: What is the recurring job that drives return visits?
- ✅ **Budgeted buyer confirmed**: Does the economic buyer have budget (not just hobby spend)?

**If recurring job is unclear or buyer has no budget** → Consider pivot or kill. Do not proceed to PRD.

### 8. Monetization Wedge (Optional in Insight Brief, Required in PRD)

**Note**: Monetization Wedge can be included in Insight Brief if known, but is required in PRD. This prevents "free audience, no business."

#### What Is the First Paid Moment?
- When does the user first pay?
- What triggers the first payment?
- What value justifies the first payment?
- How early in the journey is the paid moment?

#### What Is the Natural Expansion Revenue?
- **Seats**: How does revenue grow with team size?
- **Usage**: How does revenue grow with usage volume?
- **Tiers**: How does revenue grow with feature tiers?
- **Add-ons**: What additional products/services drive expansion?

#### What Value Metric Scales with Customer Success?
- **Value metric**: What do customers pay for? (users, API calls, storage, projects, etc.)
- **Customer success alignment**: How does the value metric align with customer success?
- **Scaling mechanism**: How does customer success drive higher value metric usage?

**Note**: Full Monetization Wedge details should be developed in PRD by Product Strategist.

### 9. Recommendation: Proceed, Pivot, or Kill

#### Recommendation
- **Decision**: [PROCEED | PIVOT | KILL]
- **Confidence**: [High | Medium | Low]
- **Rationale**: [Why this decision?]

#### If PROCEED
- **Next steps**: [What happens next?]
- **Risks to watch**: [What could change this recommendation?]
- **Success criteria**: [What would validate proceeding?]

#### If PIVOT
