## Recommendation

### Verdict: ⚠️ PIVOT

**Rationale**:
- Moderate niche durability and wave timing suggest potential but require adjustments.
- Lack of desirability signal and weak moat potential indicate a need for further validation or pivoting.

**Key Factors**:
1. Growing creator economy
2. Moderate implementation cost and risk
3. Limited moat potential
4. Lack of established demand signals

**Next Steps**:
1. **Immediate**: Conduct market research to validate demand and identify potential differentiators.
2. **Short-term (1-3 months)**: Develop a prototype to gather user feedback and refine features.
3. **Long-term (3-12 months)**: Explore partnerships or integrations with existing platforms to increase value and lock-in.

**Confidence**: Medium
