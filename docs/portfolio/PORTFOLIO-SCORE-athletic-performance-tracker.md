## Recommendation

### Verdict: ⚠️ PIVOT

**Rationale**:
- Key factors supporting verdict: Moderate niche durability, moderate wave/timing analysis
- Key risks/concerns: Low desirability signal, weak moat potential and expansion revenue depth

**Key Factors**:
1. Lack of initial desirability signals.
2. Moderate wave timing with some growth potential.
3. High implementation cost and risk.
4. Limited moat and expansion revenue potential.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Immediate**: Conduct further market validation to improve desirability signals.
2. **Short-term (1-3 months)**: Explore partnerships or integrations with existing sports platforms.
3. **Long-term (3-12 months)**: Develop unique features that enhance moat potential and increase switching costs.
