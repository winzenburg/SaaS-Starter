## Recommendation

### Verdict: ⚠️ PIVOT

**Rationale**:
- The influencer market is growing but highly competitive.
- Lack of a budgeted buyer and recurring job limits long-term revenue potential.
- Weak moat potential and high implementation risk.

**Key Factors**:
1. Competitive market with limited differentiation.
2. Lack of recurring revenue model.
3. Moderate niche durability suggests potential but requires pivoting strategy.
4. Implementation cost and risk are manageable but demand risk remains high.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Immediate**: Conduct market research to identify unique features that could increase user retention and demand.
2. **Short-term (1-3 months)**: Develop partnerships with existing influencer platforms to enhance reach and value proposition.
3. **Long-term (3-12 months)**: Explore potential pivots or additional features that could create a stronger moat and recurring revenue streams.

**Confidence**: Medium
