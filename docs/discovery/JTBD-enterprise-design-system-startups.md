### Casual Tone (30-60 seconds)

**Script:**
"Hey, I'm Alex, CTO at a Series A startup. We're building a SaaS product, and honestly, the biggest pain point right now is our UI consistency. Every time we ship a feature, the designs never look right when the developers implement them. It's frustrating - we end up with this 'sloppy and unfinished' user experience, and I'm constantly worried about our product quality and team velocity.

What I really need is a design system that works on day one, integrates seamlessly with our stack - Next.js, React, Tailwind - and helps us ship UI consistently and faster. I want to reduce my anxiety about product quality and feel confident that we're building something our team can be proud of.

The emotional driver here is pride in craftsmanship. I want to build high-quality products that users love, and I want to be seen as a strategic leader who creates efficient, scalable processes. Right now, I feel like I'm constantly firefighting instead of building systems that prevent problems."
