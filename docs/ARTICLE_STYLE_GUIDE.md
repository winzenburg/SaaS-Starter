# Article Style Guide: Indie Hackers & Hacker News

> Optimal length, voice, tone, and structure for articles targeting Indie Hackers and Hacker News audiences

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Indie Hackers

**Optimal Length:**
- **Sweet Spot**: 1,500-3,000 words
- **Minimum**: 1,000 words (too short feels incomplete)
- **Maximum**: 5,000 words (can be longer if highly valuable, but break into parts)
- **Ideal**: 2,000-2,500 words (comprehensive but digestible)

**What Works Well:**
- Process/system content (exactly what you're writing)
- Real examples and case studies
- Honest lessons learned (what worked, what didn't)
- Actionable takeaways
- Building in public content
- Technical depth with practical application

**Voice & Tone:**
- **Conversational but professional** - Like talking to a peer, not lecturing
- **Honest and transparent** - Share failures, not just successes
- **Practical and actionable** - Focus on "how" not just "what"
- **Community-focused** - Acknowledge others, cite sources, engage
- **Humble confidence** - Confident in your approach, humble about results

**Structure That Resonates:**
1. **Hook** (1-2 paragraphs) - Problem or surprising insight
2. **Context** (2-3 paragraphs) - Why this matters, your background
3. **Main Content** (bulk of article) - Process, system, framework
4. **Examples/Case Studies** - Real applications
5. **Lessons Learned** - What worked, what didn't
6. **Actionable Takeaways** - What readers can do
7. **Call to Action** - Engage, try it, contribute

**Examples of Successful Indie Hackers Posts:**
- "How I Built X in Y Days" (process-focused)
- "The System I Use to X" (systematic approach)
- "What I Learned Building X" (honest lessons)
- "Why I Killed X" (transparency)

### Hacker News

**Optimal Length:**
- **Sweet Spot**: 1,000-2,500 words
- **Minimum**: 800 words (too short gets flagged as blogspam)
- **Maximum**: 4,000 words (can work if highly technical/valuable)
- **Ideal**: 1,500-2,000 words (comprehensive but scannable)

**What Works Well:**
- Technical depth and implementation details
- Novel approaches or systems
- Data-driven insights
- Honest post-mortems
- Open source projects with technical merit
- Systems thinking and architecture

**Voice & Tone:**
- **Technical and precise** - Show your work, include code/examples
- **Intellectual honesty** - Acknowledge limitations, trade-offs
- **No fluff** - Get to the point, respect reader's time
- **Evidence-based** - Data, examples, proof
- **Critical thinking** - Question assumptions, show reasoning

**Structure That Resonates:**
1. **TL;DR** (optional but helpful) - 2-3 sentence summary
2. **Problem/Context** (2-3 paragraphs) - What you're solving, why it matters
3. **Approach** (main content) - Your system, framework, solution
4. **Implementation** (if technical) - How it works, code examples
5. **Results/Evidence** - What happened, data, metrics
6. **Discussion** - Trade-offs, limitations, future work
7. **Links/Resources** - GitHub, docs, related work

**Examples of Successful HN Posts:**
- "Show HN: X" (working product with technical merit)
- "How We Built X" (technical deep dive)
- "Why We Switched from X to Y" (technical decision-making)
- "Lessons from Building X" (honest technical post-mortem)

## Universal Best Practices (Both Platforms)

### Length Guidelines

**For Your Article Series:**

**Short Articles (1,000-1,500 words):**
- Article 1: "The Problem" - Can be shorter, sets context
- Article 8: "Technical Stack" - Technical, can be concise
- Article 9: "Results" - Lessons learned, can be focused

**Medium Articles (1,500-2,500 words):**
- Article 2: "The Solution" - Core framework, needs depth
- Article 3: "AI Orchestration" - Technical + process
- Article 4: "Portfolio Approach" - Concept + examples
- Article 5: "Documentation System" - Process + implementation
- Article 6: "Rules and Agents" - System + examples
- Article 7: "The Hub" - Product + technical

**Long Articles (2,500-4,000 words):**
- Article 10: "Open Source Vision" - Comprehensive vision piece

**Recommendation**: Aim for **1,500-2,500 words** for most articles. This is the sweet spot for both platforms.

### Voice & Tone

**Recommended Voice:**
- **"Building in Public"** - Share your process, not just results
- **"Peer-to-Peer"** - Writing to equals, not down to audience
- **"Systematic Thinker"** - Show your reasoning, not just conclusions
- **"Honest Practitioner"** - What worked, what didn't, why

**Tone Characteristics:**

1. **Conversational but Professional**
   - ✅ "We built this system because..."
   - ❌ "You should build this system because..."
   - ✅ "Here's what we learned..."
   - ❌ "Here's what you need to know..."

2. **Honest and Transparent**
   - ✅ "This worked well, but we struggled with..."
   - ❌ "This is perfect and solves everything..."
   - ✅ "We're still iterating on..."
   - ❌ "This is the final solution..."

3. **Practical and Actionable**
   - ✅ "Here's how we do X, with examples..."
   - ❌ "X is important, you should do it..."
   - ✅ "Step 1: Do this. Step 2: Do that..."
   - ❌ "Consider doing X, maybe Y..."

4. **Evidence-Based**
   - ✅ "We validated this with 5 tests, here are the results..."
   - ❌ "This is a good approach because..."
   - ✅ "Here's the data that supports this..."
   - ❌ "This makes sense because..."

5. **Humble Confidence**
   - ✅ "We've found this approach works well for us..."
   - ❌ "This is the best approach, everyone should use it..."
   - ✅ "Your mileage may vary, but here's what we learned..."
   - ❌ "This is the only way to do this..."

### Structure Template

**For Each Article:**

```markdown
# Title: [Hook + Value Proposition]

## Opening (2-3 paragraphs)
- Hook: Surprising insight, problem, or question
- Context: Why this matters, your background
- Thesis: What you'll cover, what readers will learn

## Main Content (bulk of article)
- Section 1: Core concept/framework
- Section 2: How it works (process, system, implementation)
- Section 3: Examples/case studies
- Section 4: Lessons learned (what worked, what didn't)

## Practical Application
- How to apply this
- Actionable steps
- Tools/resources needed

## Discussion
- Trade-offs and limitations
- When this works, when it doesn't
- Future improvements

## Takeaways

### Writing Style

**Do:**
- ✅ Use "I" for personal experience and authentic storytelling ("As someone who's been in the SaaS trenches...")
- ✅ Use "you" or "founders" for universal application
- ✅ Focus on general principles and frameworks (not specific brands/people)
- ✅ Include specific examples and numbers
- ✅ Show your work (process, reasoning)
- ✅ Acknowledge limitations and trade-offs
- ✅ Cite sources and give credit (without naming individuals)
- ✅ Use code blocks, diagrams, screenshots
- ✅ Break up text with headers, lists, examples
- ✅ Write scannable content (headers, bullets, bold)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Reference specific brands or product names (avoid "SaaS Starter", "Our Hub")
- ❌ Attribute frameworks to individuals by name (avoid "Greg Isenberg's approach")
- ❌ Use "we/our" to promote your specific system or product
- ❌ Include promotional links to your own product pages
- ❌ Use "you should" (too prescriptive)
- ❌ Make unsupported claims
- ❌ Hide failures or struggles
- ❌ Use marketing language or hype
- ❌ Write walls of text
- ❌ Assume prior knowledge without context
- ❌ Over-promise or oversell

---

### Formatting Best Practices

**Headers:**
- Use descriptive headers (not "Introduction", "Conclusion")
- Make headers scannable (readers scan before reading)
- Use hierarchy (H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections)

**Lists:**
- Use bullet points for scannability
- Number lists for processes/steps
- Keep list items concise (1-2 lines)

**Code/Examples:**
- Include code blocks for technical content
- Use syntax highlighting
- Explain code, don't just show it
- Include screenshots/diagrams when helpful

**Links:**
- Link to related articles in the series
- Link to GitHub repo, docs, resources
- Use descriptive link text (not "click here")

**Visuals:**
- Screenshots of the Hub, workflows, documents
- Diagrams of the system/process
- Charts/graphs for data (if available)
